	abstract = {The objective of this research was to determine if localized morphological and physiological responses of Salix nigra [Marsh.] would reflect heterogeneous soil conditions, and if these changes would alter functioning at the whole-plant level. This experiment utilized split-root rhizotrons with two separate chambers, allowing for half of the root system of each plant to be flooded while the other half was allowed to drain. Plants from these heterogeneous treatments (F/D) were compared to plants in which the entire root system was flooded (F/F) or drained (D/D). Data on soil Eh, leaf area, and photosynthesis were recorded weekly. In situ root analysis compared pre- and post-treatment visible root surface area, root length, tortuosity (τ), fractal dimension ({DF}), and fractal lacunarity (Λ). Soil in the chambers of the F/F became anoxic by day seven, and remained so for the remainder of the study. Chambers of the D/D treatment and the F/D treatment remained oxic, regardless of whether or not the individual chamber was flooded, indicating that partial root system aeration may enhance amelioration of anoxic or reducing conditions. For the measures related to photosynthetic activity, only net photosynthesis demonstrated an overall treatment effect. Generally, root length and {DF} increased in response to flooding treatments, whereas Λ decreased. τ demonstrated an interactive effect wherein changes in roots within an individual chamber depended upon the flooding condition of the neighboring chamber. {DF} was found to be highly sensitive to flooding, even if the flooding did not result in measurable soil reduction. Overall these results indicate that S. nigra may demonstrate unique morphological responses to heterogeneity in soil saturation, but localized amelioration of anoxia, rather than reallocation predominates under mildly reducing conditions.},

We use Landsat data to show that freshwater diversions, a major restoration strategy, have not increased vegetation and marsh coverage in three freshwater diversions operating for ∼19 years. Two analytic methods indicate no significant changes in either relative vegetation or overall marsh area from 1984 to 2005 in zones closest to diversion inlets. After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, these zones sustained dramatic and enduring losses in vegetation and overall marsh area, whereas the changes in similar marshes of the adjacent reference sites were relatively moderate and short-lived. We suggest that this vulnerability to storm damage reflects the introduction of nutrients in the freshwater diversions (that add insignificant amounts of additional sediments), which promotes poor rhizome and root growth in marshes where below-ground biomass historically played the dominant role in vertical accretion.},

	abstract = {This study examines the recovery of the microbial compartment following active restoration of a North American ombrotrophic peatland extracted for horticultural peat-based substrates and restored by the Sphagnum moss transfer method. We used phospholipid fatty acids ({PLFAs}) to portrait the microbial community structure and Community Level Physiological Profiles ({CLPP}) to describe the functional diversity of the microbial communities. Our results indicate that the {PLFA} profiles were different between the beginning and the end of the growing season, but that it was impossible to distinguish five different vegetation classes found along the disturbance-recovery gradient on the basis of the microbial community structure. The {pH}, the cover of mosses, Ledum groenlandicum and Eriophorum vaginatum var. spissum were the best environmental predictors for the {PLFA} composition. The newly formed peat found in aerobic conditions beneath restored Sphagnum carpets had the highest decomposition capacity, whereas the lowest rates were found in the surface samples of non-restored conditions or in the deepest horizons of the natural samples. A large proportion of the variation in the physiological profiles was explained with variables related to the vegetation cover, the physicochemical environment and the microbial structure of the community, which is very promising for future monitoring studies. Overall, this study demonstrates that the recovery of particular plant groups, namely mosses and shrubs in restored peatlands might be the driver of changes occurring in the structure of the microbial communities in restored peatlands.},

	abstract = {An exhaustive physico-chemical and morpho-granular characterization of sediments collected in Port-Camargue harbour was investigated to improve marine sediment knowledge and to study inter-particle phenomena (granular properties and agglomeration/dispersion state). In the context of dredging framework, these phenomena could lead to disperse pollution in water column through chemical mobilization (dissolution or sorption phenomena) and/or physical mobilization (dispersion/agglomeration phenomena). Moreover they could disturb sedimentation behaviour which may lead to take pollution away from harbour. This work was focused on particle solid phase of sediment. Granular aspects were jointly studied with laser granulometry, electrophoresis measurements and Scanning Electron Microscopy ({SEM}). Chemical and mineralogical properties were mainly characterized with X-ray Diffraction ({XRD}) and Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ({SEM}–{EDX}). These analyses were performed on bulk sediments and size fractioned sediments (\&lt; 20 μm; 20–40 μm; 40–63 μm; 63–80 μm; \&gt; 80 μm). Results showed that sediments can be differentiated by their granular properties (different in size distribution, shape and inter-particle interactions). A classification was proposed in function of their particle size distribution and silt percentage (very low proportion of clay is neglected): silty, silty sand and sand sediments. Furthermore, due to the presence of agglomeration/aggregation and dispersion behaviours, a morpho-granular approach was used to identify different types of agglomerates/aggregates. To minimize the impact of these phenomena on separation process of size fraction, often needed to investigate these systems, an optimized method was developed for sieving with a mechanical agitation and rinsing.

This experimental work could therefore supplement and enrich the chemical and biological approaches of marine sediments observed in the more conventional pollution mobilization studies.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/25736614},
	abstract = {We assessed the benefits of different wetland techiques for fishery resources by comparing habitat complexity, fishery support, and construction costs among five salt marsh restoration project in Galveston Bay, Texas. The restoration projects included marsh terracing at Galveston Island State Park ({GISPT}) and Pierce Marsh Preserve ({PMPT}), mound construction at Jumbile Cove ({JC}), and marsh island construction north of Galveston Island along Interstate Highway 45 at I-45 East Marsh (I45EM) and I-45 West Marsh (I45WM). The project were located in shallow estuarine waters and used bottom sediments or upland soils to construct intertidal areas that were planted with smooth cordgrass Spartina alternifora. We used a Geographic Information System ({GIS}) and high-resolution aerial photography to classify areas into land (marsh vegetation) and water and applied fishery models to assess fishery support. These models were developed to describe fine-scale distribution patterns for brown shrimp Farfantepenaeus aztecus, white shrimp Litopenaeus setiferus, and blue crab Callinectes sapidus across shallow estuarine habitat types (emergent marsh and shallow open water) of the Galveston Bay estuary. Restoration sites ranged in size from 6.9 ha (I45EM) to 68.2 ha ({GISPT}). Construction costs ranged from \$362,250 ({GISPT}) to \$74,200 (I45EM). Costs standardized to 1 ha for comparison among projects were \$40,608 (I45WM), \$11,875 ({JC}), \$10,685 (I45EM), \$8,771 ({PMPT}), and \$5,310 ({GISPT}). The I45WM project contained the greatest percentage of marsh vegetation (68\%), whereas the two terracing projects had the smallest percentage ({PMPT} = 18\%, {GISPT} = 19\%). More of the constructed marsh in the terracing projects, however, was vegetated marsh edge (located within 1 m of the marsh shoreline) than in other projects ({PMPT} = 29\%, {GISPT} = 25\%, I45EM = 20\%, {JC} = 11\%, 145WM = 9\%), and this habitat type supports the greatest densities of fishery species. Based on our modeling analysis, overall fishery support was greatest for the two I-45 projects, followed by the {PMPT} terracing project. Estimates of standing crop (number of animals) standardized to 1 ha ranged between 22,246\&\#x2013;30,863 for brown shrimp, 21,773\&\#x2013;33,139 for white shrimp, and 17,240\&\#x2013;24,927 for blue crab. The two terracing projects and I45EM had higher fishery-benefit:cost ratios (ratio of standardized net fishery value to standardized project cost) than the other projects. Although marsh terraces composed of small cells supported the highest nekton populations, terraces constructed of medium cells were more cost-effective than terraces composed of either small or large cells. Based on our modeling results, all five restored sites supported relatively high populations of fishery species compared to prerestoration conditions. However, restoration sites did not support populations equivalent to a reference marsh system. Restoration projects should maximize the area of marsh vegetation and create a high degree of water-marsh interspersion to provide the most benefit for fishery species.},

	abstract = {Abstract
The Mississippi River Delta Plain has experienced substantial wetland loss from subsidence, erosion, and sea level rise, threatening coastal communities and the ecosystems that support them. The Atchafalaya River, the largest distributary of the Mississippi River, has one of the few prograding delta features along the {\textasciitilde} 200-km deltaic coastline. Understanding changes in the Atchafalaya River Delta complex ({ARDC}) development has critical implications for future prediction and management strategy for the Mississippi River Delta Plain. This study was organized to answer two major questions: (1) how did development of the {ARDC} respond to fluctuation in riverine sediment supply over the period 1989–2010, and (2) has vegetation succession helped stabilize subaerial land? The study quantified annual total suspended sediment yields to the two {ARDC} subdeltas—Atchafalaya River subdelta ({ARSD}) and Wax Lake outlet subdelta ({WLSD})—classified delta land cover using satellite imagery over {\textasciitilde} 5-year intervals into three classes: barren land, vegetation, and open water and investigated the relationship of delta land change with sediment yield and vegetation succession. Over the entire 21-year study period, we found a net land gain of 59 km2, with the {ARSD} accounting for 58\% of this gain and {WLSD} 42\%. Sediment yield to the subdeltas decreased from an average annual of 38 megatonnes ({MT}) for {ARSD} and 18 {MT} for {WLSD} during 1989–1995 to an average annual of 24 {MT} for {ARSD} and 17 {MT} for {WLSD} during 2004–2010, corresponding to the decrease in riverine suspended sediment concentration. Concurrently, total land growth rate decreased from 2.4 km2 y− 1 to 1.6 km2 y− 1 for {ARSD} and 3.2 km2 y− 1 to 0.6 km2 y− 1 for {WLSD}. However, the {ARDC} had a net land loss of 2.1 km2 during 1999–2004 because of tropical system effects in conjunction with the lack of large river floods (defined as discharge \&gt; 13,800 m3 s− 1). On average, more than 60\% of newly vegetated land remained vegetated in subsequent years, and when compared with barren areas, vegetated land was less likely (7.3\% vs. 32\%) to be converted to water, indicating vegetative stabilization effect. However, during the period without a major flood, vegetation buffering against tropical system erosion was limited. This indicates that over the period 1989 to 2010 land growth of the {ARDC} was dictated by large flood events.},

The sediment component of this subsidy is especially important in contributing to the elevation increase of the marsh surface, a process essential for the sustainability of salt marshes during periods of sea level rise. This research tested the hypothesis that sediment subsidies have an ameliorating effect on sea level rise-induced impacts to salt marsh vigor. We assessed the plant structural and soil physico-chemical responses to different intensities of sediment subsidy in a salt marsh experiencing a high rate of relative sea level rise. Sediments were hydraulically dredged with a high fluid to solids ratio (85\%:15\%) from the Gulf of Mexico and dispersed into a Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marsh. Approximately 2 years after this fluid-sediment-enrichment, maximum sediment elevation did not exceed 30 cm above ambient and both plant cover and aboveground biomass responded positively. Sediment subsidy increased soil mineral matter, and, in turn, soil fertility and marsh elevation, and thereby reduced nutrient deficiency, flooding, and interstitial sulfide stresses. Thus, sediment subsidy generated a more favorable environment for plant growth and potentially, marsh sustainability.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
Globally, substantial quantities of organic amendments ({OAs}) such as plant residues (3.8 × 109 Mg/yr), biosolids (10 × 107 Mg/yr), and animal manures (7 × 109 Mg/yr) are produced. Recycling these {OAs} in agriculture possesses several advantages such as improving plant growth, yield, soil carbon content, and microbial biomass and activity. Nevertheless, {OA} applications hold some disadvantages such as nutrient eutrophication and greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emission. Agriculture sector plays a vital role in {GHG} emission (carbon dioxide— {CO}2, methane— {CH}4, and nitrous oxide— N2O). Though {CH}4 and N2O are emitted in less quantity than {CO}2, they are 21 and 310 times more powerful in global warming potential, respectively. Although there have been reviews on the role of mineral fertilizer application on {GHG} emission, there has been no comprehensive review on the effect of {OA} application on {GHG} emission in agricultural soils. The review starts with the quantification of various {OAs} used in agriculture that include manures, biosolids, and crop residues along with their role in improving soil health. Then, it discusses four major {OA} induced-{GHG} emission processes (i.e., priming effect, methanogenesis, nitrification, and denitrification) by highlighting the impact of {OA} application on {GHG} emission from soil. For example, globally 10 × 107 Mg biosolids are produced annually which can result in the potential emission of 530 Gg of {CH}4 and 60 Gg of N2O. The article then aims to highlight the soil, climatic, and {OA} factors affecting {OA} induced-{GHG} emission and the management practices to mitigate the emission. This review emphasizes the future research needs in relation to nitrogen and carbon dynamics in soil to broaden the use of {OAs} in agriculture to maintain soil health with minimum impact on {GHG} emission from agriculture.},

Humans alter the strength of these feedbacks by changing the climate, nutrient inputs, sediment delivery and subsidence rates. Whether wetlands continue to survive sea-level rise depends largely on how human impacts interact with rapid sea-level rise, and socio-economic factors that influence transgression into adjacent uplands.},

Our understanding of the mechanisms controlling marsh edge erosion is currently quite limited and current predictive models rely on empirical laws with limited general applicability. We propose here a simple theoretical treatment of the problem based on dimensional analysis. The identification of the variables controlling the problem and the application of Buckingham's theorem show, purely on dimensional grounds, that the rate of edge erosion and the incident wave power density are linearly related. The predictive ability of the derived relationship is then evaluated, positively, using new long-term observations from the Venice lagoon (Italy) and by re-interpreting data available in previous literature.},

This rhizotron provides: (1) non-destructive root morphometric measurements during an experiment, (2) rhizotron-specific independent experimental units, (3) a water level of up to 45 cm above the soil surface, (4) easy access for planting, and (5) the ability to harvest at multiple soil depths. A removable back allows easy access for planting and harvesting at multiple soil depths. A gasket ensures a watertight seal. Detailed methods of construction allow researchers to construct and use similar rhizotrons for experimental research. Advantages and disadvantages of the new rhizotron type are discussed.

Using the new rhizotron construction, growth response of the Cyperaceae species Eleocharis cellulosa and Rhynchospora tracyi from the Florida Everglades under different water levels and phosphate availabilities were investigated. Destructive and non-destructive analysis of development of above- and belowground biomass for the two species demonstrates that the two species differ in their response to alterations in water level, but show similarities in their response to phosphorus availability. While E. cellulosa showed larger increases in root density, root biomass, total shoot length, and shoot biomass with rising water level, the opposite was the case in R. tracyi. Both species produced more aboveground biomass with increasing phosphorus availability. Only E. cellulosa showed an increase in root density and a root biomass increase with high phosphorus availability. In R. tracyi, there was no significant increase in root biomass and root density with high phosphorus availability.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of the open waters of the San Francisco Estuary. This estuary is well known for the extent to which it has been altered through loss of wetlands, changes in hydrography, and the introduction of chemical and biological contaminants. It is also one of the most studied estuaries in the world, with much of the recent research effort aimed at supporting restoration efforts. In this review I emphasize the conceptual foundations for our current understanding of estuarine dynamics, particularly those aspects relevant to restoration. Several themes run throughout this paper. First is the critical role physical dynamics play in setting the stage for chemical and biological responses. Physical forcing by the tides and by variation in freshwater input combine to control the movement of the salinity field, and to establish stratification, mixing, and dilution patterns throughout the estuary. Many aspects of estuarine dynamics respond to interannual variation in freshwater flow; in particular, abundance of several estuarine-dependent species of fish and shrimp varies positively with flow, although the mechanisms behind these relationships are largely unknown. The second theme is the importance of time scales in determining the degree of interaction between dynamic processes. Physical effects tend to dominate when they operate at shorter time scales than biological processes; when the two time scales are similar, important interactions can arise between physical and biological variability. These interactions can be seen, for example, in the response of phytoplankton blooms, with characteristic time scales of days, to stratification events occurring during neap tides. The third theme is the key role of introduced species in all estuarine habitats; particularly noteworthy are introduced waterweeds and fishes in the tidal freshwater reaches of the estuary, and introduced clams there and in brackish water. The final theme is the rather heterogeneous set of results from monitoring and research in the estuary. For example, some topics have been subjects of intense activity both in research and monitoring (e.g., physical dynamics of the upper estuary, phytoplankton blooms), while others have received little attention (e.g., microzooplankton). In addition, both research and monitoring have emphasized some regions of the estuary (e.g., the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta) over others (e.g., San Pablo Bay). In addition, ecological modeling and synthesis has emphasized lower trophic levels over higher. Opportunities for restoration in the open waters of the estuary are somewhat limited by the lack of scientific basis for restoration, and the difficulty in detecting ecosystem responses in the context of high natural variability.},

This study investigated both the intrinsic and nutrient enhanced rates of crude oil degradation both in microcosm and core studies. In addition, limiting elements, loading rates and optimum nitrogen forms ({NH}                  4                  +                 or {NO}                  3                  -                ) were determined. Salt marshes have relatively low intrinsic degradation rates (0–3.9\% day-1) of the alkane component (C11-C44) but high rates (8–16\% day-1) of degradation of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ({PAH}) fraction (naphthalene, C1, and C2-Naphthalene and Phenanthrene, C1, and C2-Phenanthrene). Additions of nitrogen statistically enhanced degradation of many alkanes and total {PAHs} while naturally present phosphorous was found to be sufficient. Nitrogen was found to be most effective if applied as {NH}                  4                  +                 in the range of 100-500-N mg kg-1 of soil producing a pore water range of 100-670-N mg L-1.

	abstract = {Vascular plants strongly control belowground environments in most ecosystems. Invasion by vascular plants in coastal wetlands, and by cordgrasses (Spartina spp.) in particular, are increasing in incidence globally, with dramatic ecosystem-level consequences. We examined the trophic consequences of invasion by a Spartina hybrid (S. alterniflora × S. foliosa) in San Francisco Bay ({USA}) by documenting differences in biomass and trophic structure of benthic communities between sediments invaded by Spartina and uninvaded sediments. We found the invaded system shifted from an algae-based to a detritus-based food web. We then tested for a relationship between diet and tolerance to invasion, hypothesizing that species that consume Spartina detritus are more likely to inhabit invaded sediments than those that consume surface algae. Infaunal diets were initially examined with natural abundance stable isotope analyses and application of mixing models, but these yielded an ambiguous picture of food sources. Therefore, we conducted isotopic enrichment experiments by providing 15N-labeled Spartina detritus both on and below the sediment surface in areas that either contained Spartina or were unvegetated. Capitellid and nereid polychaetes, and oligochaetes, groups shown to persist following Spartina invasion of San Francisco Bay tidal flats, took up 15N from labeled native and invasive Spartina detritus. In contrast, we found that amphipods, bivalves, and other taxa less tolerant to invasion consumed primarily surficial algae, based on 13C enrichment experiments. Habitat (Spartina vs. unvegetated patches) and location of detritus (on or within sediments) did not affect 15N uptake from detritus. Our investigations support a “trophic shift” model for ecosystem response to wetland plant invasion and preview loss of key trophic support for fishes and migratory birds by shifting dominance to species not widely consumed by species at higher trophic levels.},

In a {pH} 3--10 gradient, extracts of both human and cynomolgus monkey pituitaries were each resolved into 4 growth hormone components and at least 3 prolactin components, as shown by radioimmunoassay. In narrower gradients (of 2--3 {pH} units) greater resolution was achieved; the principal growth hormone components were well separated from the principal prolactin components but there was overlapping of some minor components. A partially purified human prolactin preparation was found to contain 4 prolactin components, one of which had a prolactin/growth hormone ratio of 760. Clinical grade human growth hormone was also resolved into at least 5 prolactin and 5 growth hormone components, many of which had higher {pI} values than those found in pituitary extract. Under the conditions used, both growth hormone and prolactin were found to be polymorphic with respect to isoelectric point. Some of the human prolactin components were found to contain less than 0.2\% growth hormone by radioimmunoassay. Monkey growth hormone containing 0.01\% prolactin was isolated. These findings demonstrate that isoelectric focusing is useful for the preparation of both growth hormone and prolactin which are essentially free of one another. Furthermore, the polymorphic forms were repeatedly found in preparations obtained by several methods and from 2 different species, suggesting that these forms are not artifacts.},

	abstract = {Quantitative comparisons of created and natural wetlands are typically confounded by differences in wetland age, with created wetlands generally younger than their natural counterparts. Observed differences may be attributed to either age differences or to the inability to create wetland functions. The objective of this study was to determine if created dredge-material wetlands and comparably aged wetlands formed by natural deposition in the Atchafalaya Delta have similar sediment phosphorus compositions. Sediment cores were collected on five occasions from elevational strata (low, mid and high) in created and natural wetlands belonging to three age classes (\&lt;1–3 years old, 5–10 years old, and 15–20 years old). Sediment phosphorus fractions were determined by sequential chemical extraction.

When compared to similarly aged natural wetland sediments: (1) old, created wetland sediments had similar mean phosphorus contents at mid and low elevations, but had lower mean contents at high elevations; and (2) intermediate aged, created wetland sediments had greater phosphorus contents on a per weight basis, but mean contents were lower on a per area basis. At all elevations, the young created wetland had lower phosphorus contents than all other wetlands.

Results suggest that dredge sediment used to form the created wetlands in the Atchafalaya Delta is lower in phosphorus than the suspended sediment which forms the natural wetlands. Also, the created wetlands develop natural phosphorus characteristics through time due to sediment deposition during river flooding. In the Atchafalaya Delta, if created wetlands provide the natural flooding cycle, then they begin to develop natural phosphorus characteristics between 10 and 20 years after formation.},

The intertidal salt marsh {speciesSpartina} anglica is well known for its capacity to enhance sediment accretion within its canopy by reducing hydrodynamic energy. Sediment accretion is favorable {toSpartina}, as it reduces inundation stress, enhances soil drainage, and enhances nutrient availability. Shoot density and clonal architecture showed a large variation that was strongly correlated with the marsh elevation and sediment type. This correlation showed that at the lowest elevations at the muddy site,Spartina tussocks had the highest shoot density, which is known to be favorable for sediment accretion by reduction of hydrodynamic energy. There was also a strong positive correlation between the amount of sediment that accumulated within a tussock and gully formation around {thatSpartina} tussock. The tussocks at the lowest elevations at the muddy site had the lowest lateral tussock growth. At the highest elevations at the sandy site, stem densities were lower and there was a relatively high rate of clonal expansion and marsh formation. At this location, we also observed tussock mortality due to erosion of several of these openly structured tussocks. Based on the observed correlations, we hypothesize that the morphology {ofSpartina} represents trade-offs between the capacity to maximize habitat modification through sediment trapping by having a high shoot density versus the capacity to maximize clonal expansion by spreading shoots widely and the capacity of maximal clonal expansion by spreading shoots widely versus the risk of tussock mortality due to insufficient modification of the habitat that makes the tussock vulnerable to erosion. Our results indicated that morphological variation and habitat modification are strongly correlated for the autogenic ecosystem {engineerS}. anglica.},

One popular solution to stabilize while conserving intertidal habitat is the use of “living shoreline” techniques which are designed to mimic natural shoreline communities by using native plants and animals. However, little information is available on the success of living shoreline stabilization. This project evaluated the wave energy attenuation associated with living shorelines that contained Crassostrea virginica (eastern oyster) and/or Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) in a wave tank. Four living shoreline techniques were assessed, including a control (sediment only), oysters alone, cordgrass alone, and a combination of oysters plus cordgrass. Time since deployment (newly deployed, one-year after deployment) was also assessed to see how wave energy attenuation changed with natural oyster recruitment and plant growth. Wave energy was calculated for each newly deployed and one-year old shoreline stabilization treatment using capacitance wave gauges and generated waves that were representative of boat wakes in Mosquito Lagoon, a shallow-water estuary in Florida. All one-year old treatments attenuated significantly more energy than newly-deployed treatments. The combination of one-year old S. alterniflora plus live C. virginica was the most effective as this treatment reduced 67 \% of the wave energy created by a single recreational boat wake, compared to bare sediment. Natural resource managers and landowners facing shoreline erosion issues can use this information to create effective stabilization protocols that preserve shorelines while conserving native intertidal habitats.},

Sewage sludge addition to soils resulted in an increase in the content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in these soils. This increase was proportional to the quantity of sewage sludge applied. The results obtained showed that during a 42/54-month period, more than half of the individual {PAHs} introduced into the soil with sewage sludge were degraded. The scope of dissipation depended on the sewage sludge dose and the use to which the area was put. In the experiment with the willow only in the case of the highest sludge dose was a decrease in the {PAH} content above 50\% noted; whereas in the case of the experiment with the field plants, it was higher by 50\% for all sewage sludge doses. In experiment with field plants the highest scope of individual {PAH} disappearance was observed in the soil with the sewage sludge dose amounting to 300 Mg ha−1. In experiment with willow a relatively high dissipation of individual {PAHs} ({\textgreater}50\%) was found in the treatment with the highest sludge dose (600 Mg ha−1).
A wider {PAH} dissipation range in the experiment with field plants was conditioned by the more favourable conditions created as a result of the breeding treatments applied. Agrotechnical treatments clearly increased the disappearance of the {PAHs} in those soils fertilized with the lowest sewage sludge doses (30 and 75 Mg ha−1). The results obtained showed that the preferred method of treating a light soil fertilised with sewage sludges should be a one-year system, with a sludge application of ⩽75 Mg ha−1.},

This review highlights the advanced mechanical design of plant stems from the integral level of stem structures down to the fiber-reinforced-composite character of the cell walls. Thereby we intend not only to provide insight into structure-function relationships at the individual levels of hierarchy but to further discuss how growth forms and habits of plant stems are closely interrelated with the peculiarities of their tissue and cell structure and mechanics. This concept is extended to a further key feature of plants, namely, adaptive growth as a reaction to mechanical perturbation and/or changing environmental conditions. These mechanical design principles of plant stems can serve as concept generators for advanced biomimetic materials and may inspire materials and engineering sciences research.},

Seasonal fluxes of trace metals into the shoots of the living plants were measured as was their transfer to the dead plant community through mortality. Disappearance from the latter community (through fragmentation, leaching and excretion) was calculated. Seasonal data were summed to produce annual input-output budgets. The flux varied from 3 mg/m2 for Cr in a stand of Potentilla pacifica to 15,000 mg/m2 for Fe in Carex lyngbyei. The uptake of trace metals from contaminated dredged material was compared with that from natural soils using modified buckets placed in the marsh. Four plants Carex lyngbyei, Distichlis spicata, Deschampsia cespitosa, and Salicornia virginica) were tested for Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn.

This study provides hydraulic geometry relationships for predicting the depth, width, and cross-sectional area of mature tidal channels as functions of contributing marsh area or tidal prism. The relationships are based on data from San Francisco Bay coastal salt marshes ranging in size from 2 to 5,700 ha. These hydraulic geometry relationships refine and expand on earlier relationships. Relationships for mature marshes can be used to predict the direction and rate of evolution of a channel in an immature or perturbed marsh system. Channel evolution data for three youthful tidal channels, ages 4 to 13 years, suggest that the channels are converging on their predicted equilibrium morphology. Two channels are eroding in response to significant increases in upstream tidal prism. They have enlarged first by deepening, in one case after 13 years to beyond the predicted equilibrium depth, and then widening through slumping of the channel banks. The third channel, a new one forming in a depositional mudflat, is converging on its equilibrium morphology after 13 years but will likely take several decades to equilibrate.},

	abstract = {The global decline in estuarine and coastal ecosystems ({ECEs}) is affecting a number of critical benefits, or ecosystem services. We review the main ecological services across a variety of {ECEs}, including marshes, mangroves, nearshore coral reefs, seagrass beds, and sand beaches and dunes. Where possible, we indicate estimates of the key economic values arising from these services, and discuss how the natural variability of {ECEs} impacts their benefits, the synergistic relationships of {ECEs} across seascapes, and management implications. Although reliable valuation estimates are beginning to emerge for the key services of some {ECEs}, such as coral reefs, salt marshes, and mangroves, many of the important benefits of seagrass beds and sand dunes and beaches have not been assessed properly. Even for coral reefs, marshes, and mangroves, important ecological services have yet to be valued reliably, such as cross-ecosystem nutrient transfer (coral reefs), erosion control (marshes), and pollution control (mangroves). An important issue for valuing certain {ECE} services, such as coastal protection and habitat–fishery linkages, is that the ecological functions underlying these services vary spatially and temporally. Allowing for the connectivity between {ECE} habitats also may have important implications for assessing the ecological functions underlying key ecosystems services, such coastal protection, control of erosion, and habitat–fishery linkages. Finally, we conclude by suggesting an action plan for protecting and/or enhancing the immediate and longer-term values of {ECE} services. Because the connectivity of {ECEs} across land–sea gradients also influences the provision of certain ecosystem services, management of the entire seascape will be necessary to preserve such synergistic effects. Other key elements of an action plan include further ecological and economic collaborative research on valuing {ECE} services, improving institutional and legal frameworks for management, controlling and regulating destructive economic activities, and developing ecological restoration options.},

Wind and water movements associated with the hurricane resulted in the formation of compressed marsh, thick sediment deposits, wrack deposition, areas of salt burning, and scour. No sites were entirely without some impact. Sediments were deposited over large areas of coastal marsh. Marsh sites near Atchafalaya Bay had the thickest post-storm accumulations documented, up to 16 cm on average, while inland marsh sites accumulated lesser amounts of sediments. The nature of the sediment deposited on the marsh surface varied with location relative to the path of the storm and sources of sediment. Lateral compression resulted in surface relief 5-10 times greater than normal surface relief. Plant cover quickly recovered in all hurricane impact types except for scour areas and areas of thick wrack accumulation. Shifts in species dominance occurred in laterally compressed areas and are related to increased elevations. These findings suggest that hurricanes result in a variety of impacts in coastal Louisiana marshes and that the heterogeneity of the coastal landscape contributes to the magnitude and distribution of these impacts.},

	abstract = {In the Northeastern U.S., salt marsh area is in decline. Habitat change analysis has revealed fragmentation, displacement of high marsh by low marsh species, and marsh drowning, while development of adjacent uplands limits upslope migration. Measures of marsh vegetation loss for eight sites in Rhode Island and New York between ca.1970 and 2011 indicate that substantial loss has occurred over past decades, with higher loss rates found for lower elevation salt marshes. Using inundation experiments, field surveys, and {LiDAR} datasets, we developed an elevation-productivity relationship for Spartina alterniflora specific to the U.S. Northeast, and located current salt marsh orthometric heights on this curve. We estimate that 87 \% of Northeastern salt marshes are located at elevations where growth is limited by inundation. By manipulating water column nutrients, precipitation, and elevation, we further found that altered precipitation regime was associated with significant reductions in biomass, and that nutrient enrichment adversely impacts organic matter accumulation and peat formation. These results provide evidence that Northeastern U.S. marshes are vulnerable to the effects of accelerated sea level rise, and that neither precipitation changes, nor cultural eutrophication, will contribute positively to long-term salt marsh survival.},

2) technology has been proposed as a mechanism to minimize wetland impacts associated with traditional bucket dredging technologies and to restore soil elevations in deteriorated marshes of the Mississippi River delta. The impact of spray dredging on vegetated marsh and adjacent shallow-water habitat (formerly vegetated marsh that deteriorated to open water) was evaluated in a 0.5-ha Spartina alterniflora-dominated salt marsh in coastal Louisiana. The thickness of dredged sediment deposits was determined from artificial soil marker horizons and soil elevation change was determined from sedimentation–erosion tables ({SET}) established prior to spraying in both sprayed and reference marshes. The vertical accretion and elevation change measurements were made simultaneously to allow for calculation of shallow (∼5 m depth) subsidence (accretion minus elevation change). Measurements made immediately following spraying in July 1996 revealed that stems of S. alterniflora were knocked down by the force of the spray and covered with 23 mm of dredged material. Stems of S. alterniflora soon recovered, and by July 1997 the percent cover of S. alterniflora had increased three-fold over pre-project conditions. Thus, the layer of dredged material was thin enough to allow for survival of the S. alterniflora plants, with no subsequent colonization by plant species typical of higher marsh zones. By February 1998, 62 mm of vertical accretion accumulated at this site, and little indication of disturbance was noted. Although not statistically significant, soil elevation change was greater than accretion on average at both the spray and reference marshes, suggesting that subsurface expansion caused by increased root biomass production and/or pore water storage influence elevation in this marsh region. In the adjacent shallow water pond, 129 mm of sediment was deposited in July 1996 as a result of spraying, and despite initial shallow subsidence and continual erosion through February 1998, water bottom elevation was raised sufficiently to allow S. alterniflora to invade via rhizome growth from the adjacent marsh. Hence, thin-layer deposition of dredged material at this site was effective at restoring and maintaining marsh elevation after 1.5 years. However, if the open water sediment deposits are not soon completely stabilized via further vegetative colonization, erosion may eventually lower elevations to the level where emergent vegetation cannot persist.},

	abstract = {Given the history and future risk of storm surge in the United States, functional storm protection techniques are needed to protect vital sectors of the economy and coastal communities. It is widely hypothesized that coastal wetlands offer protection from storm surge and wave action, though the extent of this protection is unknown due to the complexities of flow through vegetation. Here we present the sensitivity of storm-surge numerical modeling results to various coastal wetlands characteristics. An idealized grid domain and 400-km2 marsh feature were used to evaluate the effects of marsh characteristics on hurricane surge, including the effects of bottom friction, elevation, and continuity (the ratio of healthy marsh to open water area within the total wetland area).
Through coupled hydrodynamic and wave model simulations, it is confirmed that increased bottom friction reduces storm-surge levels for most storms. However, increases in depth associated with marsh elevation loss generally results in a reduction of surge. As marsh continuity is decreased, coastal surge increases as a result of enhanced surge conveyance into and out of the marsh. Storm surge is parameterized in terms of marsh morphology, namely marsh elevation, frictional characteristics, and degree of segmentation, which will assist in the justification for and optimization of marsh restoration in terms of storm protection.},

Soils were sampled in five transplanted marshes ranging in age from 1 to 15 yr and in five nearby natural marshes along the North Carolina coast. Dry weight of macroorganic matter ({MOM}), soil bulk density, {pH}, humic matter, and extractable P also were measured. Nutrient pools increased with increasing marsh age and hydroperiod. Nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon pools were largest in soils of irregularly flooded natural marshes. The contribution of {MOM} to marsh nutrient reservoirs was 6–45\%, 2–22\%, and 1–7\% of the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively. Rates of nutrient accumulation in transplanted marshes ranged from 2.6–10.0, 0.03–1.10, and 84–218 kmol ha−1yr−1 of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon, respectively. Accumulation rates were greater in the irregularly flooded marshes compared to the regularly flooded marshes. Approximately 11 to 12\% and 20\% of the net primary production of emergent vegetation was buried in sediments of the regularly flooded and irregularly flooded transplanted marshes, respectively. Macroorganic matter nutrient pools develop rapidly in transplanted marshes and may approximate natural marshes within 15 to 30 yr.

During disaster a kind of functional disorder gets created where women had to face challenges different from men. Women have to face loss of livelihood opportunities, deprivation from relief materials, sexual harassment and enjoy little scope of participation in any response or management activities. Likewise, they also suffer from inverse care law after disaster. Contrary to that, disaster also creates a condition to accrue diverse positive and constructive impacts including women׳s transformative role which often do not get reported.

The above-ground parts of the vegetation reduce wave energy, while the below-ground parts strengthen the soil. On the other hand, vegetation development may be restricted as a result of wave stress. Interactions between waves, soil erosion, and emergent vegetation were studied during three consecutive years. Two helophyte species, Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steudel and Scirpus lacustris L., were planted in separate bank sections on two types of sediment, sand and silty sand, in a wave tank. Regular waves were transmitted through 4 m wide bank sections with and without helophytes growing on a horizontal part. Bank profiles, wave transmission patterns and vegetation parameters were measured after exposure to waves with a height of 10 cm (Year 1) and 23 cm (Years 2 and 3). Both 10 cm and 23 cm waves affected bank profiles. Erosion of the banks occurred due to downslope transport of sediment. Soil erosion patterns closely reflected the patterns of standing waves over the horizontal part of the bank. Emergent vegetation influenced the erosive impact of waves by both sediment reinforcement and wave attenuation. A smaller amount of net erosion was measured in the wave-exposed sections covered by vegetation than in the unplanted sections. The stands of Scirpus lacustris were damaged due to uprooting of rhizome parts by 23 cm waves, followed by increased erosion of the soil. No damage occurred to the Phragmites australis stands. The greatest wave attenuation (measured as relative wave height reduction) was measured in the fully developed vegetation in August of each year in both types of vegetation.},

In both laboratory flume studies and controlled field experiments, we show that common salt marsh plants do not significantly mitigate the total amount of erosion along a wetland edge. We found that the soil type is the primary variable that influences the lateral erosion rate and although plants do not directly reduce wetland edge erosion, they may do so indirectly via modification of soil parameters. We conclude that coastal vegetation is best-suited to modify and control sedimentary dynamics in response to gradual phenomena like sea-level rise or tidal forces, but is less well-suited to resist punctuated disturbances at the seaward margin of salt marshes, specifically breaking waves.},

	abstract = {Reintroduction of fresh water to coastal systems with altered hydrologic regimes is a management option for restoring degraded wetland habitats. Plant production in these systems is believed to be enhanced by increased nutrient availability and reduced salinity. Although studies have documented nutrient limitation and salinity stress in coastal marshes, interpreting the effects of freshwater reintroduction on plant production is difficult because high nutrient availability often is confounded with low salinity. We tested the hypothesis that plant growth response to nutrients does not vary with salinity in a greenhouse study. Treatments consisted of four nutrient concentrations and four non-lethal salinity levels; plant response was measured as biomass accumulation after 144 days of exposure. The significant interaction between salinity and nutrient concentrations indicates that response of Spartina patens marshes to freshwater inflows would vary by site-specific soil conditions. Biomass decreased with increased salinity at all four nutrient concentrations with variation among the nutrient concentrations decreasing as salinity increased. We demonstrate the importance of considering ambient salinity and nutrient soil conditions in restoration planning involving freshwater inflow. We propose salinity should remain a primary concern in restoration plans targeted at improving degraded S. patens-dominated marsh habitat.},

Bayou sediments represent the low flow conditions, when the water is constrained within the canals with high potential for transport to the coastal ocean. The marsh soil represents the high flow diversion events when flood water inundates up into the marshes. We sought to remove the plant effect by using cores containing bayou sediment and marsh soil, removing all roots and flooding with a water column containing 2 mg {NO}3-N L−1. Water column nitrate and ammonium concentration were monitored over 9 d. Net nitrate loss in bayou sediments was 9.5 ± 1.5 mg N m−2 d−1 while the nitrate loss was significantly less at 7.2 ± 0.9 mg N m−2 d−1 in the marsh soil. A comparison of nitrate reduction rates in vegetated and non-vegetated marsh soils indicated that the rate of denitrification increased tenfold in vegetated soils. This increase could be attributed to the “plant effect”. Our results suggest that operating diversions on the high flow end of the spectrum would promote nitrate delivery over the vegetated marsh rather than flowing only through canals. Flooding of the vegetated marsh maximizes the potential for removal of riverine nitrate and limits delivery of nitrate to the coastal ocean, thereby mitigating expressions of eutrophication including algal blooms and hypoxia.},

	abstract = {Spectral energy dissipation of random waves due to salt marsh vegetation (Spartina alterniflora) was analyzed using field data collected during a tropical storm. Wave data (significant wave heights up to 0.4 m in 0.8 m depth) were measured over a two-day period along a 28 m transect using 3 pressure transducers. The storm produced largely bimodal spectra on the wetland, consisting of low-frequency swell (7–10 s) and high-frequency (2–4.5 s) wind-sea. The energy dissipation varied across the frequency scales with the largest magnitude observed near the spectral peaks, above which the dissipation gradually decreased. The wind-sea energy dissipated largely in the leading section of the instrument array in the wetland, but the low-frequency swell propagated to the subsequent section with limited energy loss. Across a spectrum, dissipation did not linearly follow incident energy, and the degree of non-linearity varied with the dominant wave frequency. A rigid-type vegetation model was used to estimate the frequency-dependent bulk drag coefficient. For a given spectrum, this drag coefficient increased gradually up to the peak frequency and remained generally at a stable value at the higher frequencies. This spectral variation was parameterized by employing a frequency-dependent velocity attenuation parameter inside the canopy. This parameter had much less variability among incident wave conditions, compared to the variability of the bulk drag coefficient, allowing its standardization into a single, frequency-dependent curve for velocity attenuation inside a canopy. It is demonstrated that the spectral drag coefficient predicts the frequency-dependent energy dissipation with more accuracy than the integral coefficient.},

In particular, along the east-facing levees of the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet ({MRGO}), the overtopping caused numerous levee breaches. This paper will focus on the {MRGO} levees, and will attempt to recreate the hydrodynamic conditions during Katrina to provide an estimate of the experienced overtopping rates. Due to the irregular beach profiles leading up to the levees and the general hydrodynamic complexity of the overtopping in this area, a Boussinesq wave model is employed. This model is shown to be accurate for the prediction of waves shoaling and breaking over irregular beach profiles, as well as for the overtopping of levees. With surge levels provided by {ADCIRC} and nearshore wave heights by {STWAVE}, the Boussinesq model is used to predict conditions at the {MRGO} levees for 10 h near the peak of Katrina. The peak simulated overtopping rates correlate well with expected levee damage thresholds and observations of damage in the levee system. Finally, the predicted overtopping rates are utilized to estimate a volumetric flooding rate as a function of time for the entire 20 km stretch of east-facing {MRGO} levees.},

	abstract = {The Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 have spurred global interest in the role of coastal wetlands and vegetation in reducing storm surge and flood damages. Evidence that coastal wetlands reduce storm surge and attenuate waves is often cited in support of restoring Gulf Coast wetlands to protect coastal communities and property from hurricane damage. Yet interdisciplinary studies combining hydrodynamic and economic analysis to explore this relationship for temperate marshes in the Gulf are lacking. By combining hydrodynamic analysis of simulated hurricane storm surges and economic valuation of expected property damages, we show that the presence of coastal marshes and their vegetation has a demonstrable effect on reducing storm surge levels, thus generating significant values in terms of protecting property in southeast Louisiana. Simulations for four storms along a sea to land transect show that surge levels decline with wetland continuity and vegetation roughness. Regressions confirm that wetland continuity and vegetation along the transect are effective in reducing storm surge levels. A 0.1 increase in wetland continuity per meter reduces property damages for the average affected area analyzed in southeast Louisiana, which includes New Orleans, by \$99-\$133, and a 0.001 increase in vegetation roughness decreases damages by \$24-\$43. These reduced damages are equivalent to saving 3 to 5 and 1 to 2 properties per storm for the average area, respectively.},

Prominent peaks in the spectra are identified with the arrival of gusts, the stalk-waving frequency, and the frequency of oscillations in canopy height.

	abstract = {The distribution of New England salt marsh communities is intrinsically linked to the magnitude, frequency, and duration of tidal inundation. Cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) exclusively inhabits the frequently flooded lower elevations, whereas a mosaic of marsh hay (Spartina patens), spike grass (Distichlis spicata), and black rush (Juncus gerardi) typically dominate higher elevations. Monitoring plant zonal boundaries in two New England salt marshes revealed that low-marsh cordgrass rapidly moved landward at the expense of higher-marsh species between 1995 and 1998. Plant macrofossils from sediment cores across modern plant community boundaries provided a 2,500-year record of marsh community composition and documented the migration of cordgrass into the high marsh. Isotopic dating revealed that the initiation of cordgrass migration occurred in the late 19th century and continued through the 20th century. The timing of the initiation of cordgrass migration is coincident with an acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise recorded by the New York tide gauge. These results suggest that increased flooding associated with accelerating rates of sea-level rise has stressed high-marsh communities and promoted landward migration of cordgrass. If current rates of sea-level rise continue or increase slightly over the next century, New England salt marshes will be dominated by cordgrass. If climate warming causes sea-level rise rates to increase significantly over the next century, these cordgrass-dominated marshes will likely drown, resulting in extensive losses of coastal wetlands.},

	abstract = {After three decades ofexperience, environmental managers continue toquestion the use of dredged material for creation andrestoration of Spartina alternifloramarshes. Different uses of the term `success' have led to someconfusion, and poor recognition of the limitations ofresearch design have contributed to confusion instudies comparing dredged material and naturalmarshes. This paper uses data from a number ofsources to compare dredged material and naturalmarshes. Quantitative analyses based on dataavailable in the scientific literature suggest thatmean values for aboveground and belowground biomass,organic carbon in sediments, polychaete densities, andcrustacean densities may differ in dredged materialand natural marshes. There is not sufficient evidenceto conclude that differences are present for othervariables, such as densities of stems, oligochaetes,or fish. Cumulative quantitative data do not supportthe contention that dredged material sites becomeincreasingly similar to nearby natural marshes overtime as a general rule, although some attributes ofindividual dredged material marshes may becomeincreasingly similar to some natural marshes. Although it is clear that dredged material marshesprovide habitat for birds, limited data suggest thatdredged material marshes may provide habitat for adifferent community of birds than natural marshes. Similarly, limited data suggest that geomorphologicalfeatures found in natural marshes are not duplicatedin dredged material marshes. In short, datasummarized from the literature suggest that dredgedmaterial marshes provide some of the functions ofnatural marshes but probably do not replace all of thefunctions of lost natural marshes.},

	abstract = {Riparian vegetation has different impacts on stream processes depending upon its position in a catchment. Native riparian vegetation is increasingly becoming the favoured stream management tool but managers need to locate revegetation schemes where they will most effectively achieve ecological, geomorphological, or other, project goals. Using the Latrobe River in {SE} Australia as an example, this paper illustrates a structured decision-making approach for assessing the role of vegetation in stream bank erosion at different points throughout a catchment. Three bank-erosion process groups are identified: subaerial preparation, fluvial entrainment, and mass failure. Although these processes act on banks throughout the catchment there exists spatial zoning in the dominance of each process group over the others. Bank erosion in upper reaches is dominated by subaerial preparation, in mid-basin reaches by fluvial entrainment, and in the lower reaches by mass failure. We find that in upper reaches, windthrown trees are responsible for most bank sediment transfer to the flow. Where direct fluvial entrainment of bank material is the dominant erosion process, flow resistance due to vegetation becomes crucial. In reaches where bank slumping is the dominant erosion process, increased bank shear strength due to root reinforcement is the major role of vegetation in stabilising banks. Other effects, such as tree surcharge, and altered bank hydrology appear to exert only minor influences on the slumping process. Considering the above variables we are able to define a critical zone in which revegetation will be most effective in reducing bank erosion. On the Latrobe River, this zone occurs in that portion of the river where it first leaves the mountain front and meanders across a broad floodplain. This reach occupies the second quarter of the river's length. This information, combined with other scale analyses (e.g. ecological, hydrological), will assist river managers to plan physically based riparian revegetation strategies.},

	abstract = {Benthic metabolism and nutrient exchange across the sediment-water interface were examined over an annual cycle at four sites along a freshwater to marine transect in the Parker River-Plum Island Sound estuary in northeastern Massachusetts, U.S. Sediment organic carbon content was highest at the freshwater site (10.3\%) and decreased along the salinity gradient to 0.2\% in the sandy sediments at the marine end of the estuary. C:N ratios were highest in the mid estuary (23:1) and lowest near the sea (11:1). Chlorophyll a in the surface sediments was high along the entire length of the estuary (39–57 mg chlorophyll a m−2) but especially so in the sandy marine sediments (172 mg chlorophyll a m−2). Chlorophyll a to phaeophytin ratios suggested most chlorophyll is detrital, except at the sandy marine site. Porewater sulfide values varied seasonally and between sites, reflecting both changes in sulfate availability as overlying water salinity changed and sediment metabolism. Patterns of sediment redox potential followed those of sulfide. Porewater profiles of inorganic N and P reflected strong seasonal patterns in remineralization, accumulation, and release. Highest porewater {NH}4 + values were found in upper and mid estuarine sediments, occasionally exceeding 1 {mM} N. Porewater nitrate was frequently absent, except in the sandy marine sediments where concentrations of 8 μM were often observed. Annual average respiration was lowest at the marine site (13 mmol O2 m−2 d−1 and 21 mmol {TCO}2 m−2 d−1) and highest in the mid estuary (130 mmol O2 m−2 d−1 and 170 mmol {TCO}2 m−2 d−1) where clam densities were also high. N2O and {CH}4 fluxes were low at all stations throughout the year: Over the course, of a year, sediments varied from being sources to sinks of dissolved organic C and N, with the overall spatial pattern related closely to sediment organic content. There was little correlation between {PO}4 3− flux and metabolism, which we attribute to geochemical processes. At the two sites having the lowest salinities, {PO}4 3− flux was directed into the sediments. On average, between 22\% and 32\% of total system metabolism was attributable to the benthos. The mid estuary site was an exception, as benthic metabolism accounted for 95\% of the total, which is attributable to high densities of filter-feeding clams. Benthic remineralization supplied from less than 1\% to over 190\% of the N requirements and 0\% to 21\% of the P requirements of primary producers in this system. Estimates of denitrification calculated from stoichiometry of C and N fluxes ranged from 0\% for the upper and mid estuary site to 35\% for the freshwater site to 100\% of sediment organic N remineralization at the marine site. We hypothesize that low values in the upper and mid estuary are attributable to enhanced {NH}4 + fluxes during summer due to desorption of exchangeable ammonium from rising porewater salinity. {NH}4 + desorption during summer may be a mechanism that maintains high rates of pelagic primary production at a time of low inorganic N inputs from the watershed.},

	abstract = {It is well known that landward transport of fine sediments on tidal flats is caused by lag effects, of which the scour lag and the settling lag are the best known. These lag effects result from a combination of sediment properties and hydrodynamic asymmetries. However, it is not well-understood how, in a quantitative way, these lag effects depend on the sediment properties and the hydrodynamic forcing, and what the relative importance of these sediment properties and hydrodynamics is. As a result, it is not known which lag effect is more important under which conditions. We therefore set out to explore the relative importance of hydrodynamics and sediment properties on tidal-flat sedimentation using a schematized 2DV cross-shore profile model with a tidal range of 6 m and an intertidal width of ∼5 km. The effect of hydrodynamics is parameterized through a varying offshore tidal asymmetry and four different cross-shore profiles (a horizontal, convex, linear and concave profile). The effect of sediment properties is examined by evaluating a range of settling velocities ws and critical bed shear stresses for erosion τcr. The main findings of this work are that (1) conditions of maximum sediment deposition rates exist for ws ∼0.5 mm/s and τcr ∼0.1 Pa, (2) deposition rates due to slack tide asymmetry are comparable to symmetric tides, while peak flow asymmetry produces the greatest deposition rates, (3) tidal flat deposition rates are greatest for concave profiles and least for convex profiles mainly due to the horizontal velocity gradient, and (4) the type of lag effect dominating landward transport varies spatially.},

In flooded rice paddies these methanotrophs compete for available O2 with other types of bacteria. Soil incubation studies and most-probable-number ({MPN}) counts of oxygen consumers show that microbial oxygen consumption rates were dominated by heterotrophic and methanotrophic respiration. {MPN} counts of methanotrophs showed large spatial and temporal variability. The most abundant methanotrophs (a Methylocystis sp.) and heterotrophs (a Pseudomonas sp. and {aRhodococcus} sp.) were isolated and characterized. Growth dynamics of these bacteria under carbon and oxygen limitations are presented. Theoretical calculations based on measured growth dynamics show that methanotrophs were only able to outcompete heterotrophs at low oxygen concentrations (frequently {\textless}5 μM). The oxygen concentration at which methanotrophs won the competition from heterotrophs did not depend on methane concentration, but it was highly affected by organic carbon concentrations in the paddy soil. Methane oxidation was severely inhibited at high acetate concentrations. This is in accordance with competition experiments {betweenPseudomonas} spp. and Methylocystis spp. carried out at different oxygen and carbon concentrations. Likely, methane oxidation mainly occurs at microaerophilic and low-acetate conditions and thus not directly at the root surface. Acetate and oxygen concentrations in the rice rhizosphere are in the critical range for methane oxidation, and a high variability in methane oxidation rates is thus expected.},

	abstract = {Transport of particulate organic material can impact watershed sediment and nutrient budgets and can alter the geomorphologic evolution of shallow aquatic environments. Prediction of organic aggregate (“floc”) transport in these environments requires knowledge of how hydraulics and biota affect the entrainment, settling, and aggregation of particles. This study evaluated the aggregation and field transport dynamics of organic floc from a low-gradient floodplain wetland with flow-parallel ridges and sloughs in the Florida Everglades. Floc dynamics were evaluated in a rotating annular flume and in situ in the field. Under present managed conditions in the Everglades, floc is not entrained by mean flows but is suspended via biological production in the water column and bioturbation. Aggregation was a significant process affecting Everglades floc at high flume flow velocities (7.0 cm s−1) and during recovery from high flow; disaggregation was not significant for the tested flows. During moderate flows when floc dynamics are hydrodynamically controlled, it is possible to model floc transport using a single “operative floc diameter” that accurately predicts fluxes downstream and to the bed. In contrast, during high flows and recovery from high flows, aggregation dynamics should be simulated. When entrained by flow in open-water sloughs, Everglades floc will be transported downstream in multiple deposition and reentrainment events but will undergo net settling when transported onto ridges of emergent vegetation. We hypothesize that net transport of material from open to vegetated areas during high flows is critical for forming and maintaining distinctive topographic patterning in the Everglades and other low-gradient floodplains.},

In the Skagit Delta marshes (Washington, United States), total channel surface area and length and surface area of the largest channel draining an island scaled disproportionately with island area, suggesting restoration of a 100-ha site would be preferable to restoration of 10 separate 10-ha sites to maximize channel length and area. A model of channel formation through random island conglomeration replicated observed scaling patterns, linking channel scaling to blind channel evolution from river distributaries. Channel size and complexity varied spatially, with significant deficits in an eroding marsh isolated from river distributaries and riverine sediments.},

While biogeomorphic feedbacks preserve the morphology of intertidal surfaces covered by marshland, we demonstrate with numerical model and field experimentation that temporary disturbance to vegetation facilitates rapid and widespread degradation. Vertical accretion slows in disturbed areas, allowing localized submergence of the marsh platform, tidal prism enlargement, and permanent channel network expansion. Vegetated portions of an episodically disturbed platform accrete more rapidly than rates of relative sea level rise, giving submerging marshland the appearance of maintaining elevation. This feedback between vegetation disturbance and channel erosion, and its effect on platform accretion, may explain peculiar patterns of wetland loss in Europe and North America.},

	abstract = {We assessed the role of vegetation and hydrology in the Si cycle in the Okavango Delta. Our results show a large storage of biogenic Si ({BSi}) in vegetation and the sediments. The biological storage is among the highest observed so far for any ecosystem worldwide. Floodplain vegetation accumulates similar amounts of {BSi} in both the temporary floodplains and the permanent floodplains, with most values observed between 20 and 100 g Si m−2. This vegetation Si, after litterfall, contributes to a large biogenic Si storage in the sediments. In temporary floodplains, sediments contain less {BSi} (375–1950 g Si m−2 in the top 5 cm) than in the permanent floodplains (1950–3600 g Si m−2 in the top 5 cm). {BSi} concentrations in the floodplain sediments decline exponentially indicating rapid dissolution. In the occasional and seasonal floodplains, unidirectional solute transfer from floodplains to the islands will remove Si from the riverine systems. Our work clearly emphasizes the crucial role of floodplains and wetlands in Si transport through tropical rivers, and the potential interference of hydrology with this role.},

	abstract = {For more than a century, coastal wetlands have been recognized for their ability to stabilize shorelines and protect coastal communities. However, this paradigm has recently been called into question by small-scale experimental evidence. Here, we conduct a literature review and a small meta-analysis of wave attenuation data, and we find overwhelming evidence in support of established theory. Our review suggests that mangrove and salt marsh vegetation afford context-dependent protection from erosion, storm surge, and potentially small tsunami waves. In biophysical models, field tests, and natural experiments, the presence of wetlands reduces wave heights, property damage, and human deaths. Meta-analysis of wave attenuation by vegetated and unvegetated wetland sites highlights the critical role of vegetation in attenuating waves. Although we find coastal wetland vegetation to be an effective shoreline buffer, wetlands cannot protect shorelines in all locations or scenarios; indeed large-scale regional erosion, river meandering, and large tsunami waves and storm surges can overwhelm the attenuation effect of vegetation. However, due to a nonlinear relationship between wave attenuation and wetland size, even small wetlands afford substantial protection from waves. Combining man-made structures with wetlands in ways that mimic nature is likely to increase coastal protection. Oyster domes, for example, can be used in combination with natural wetlands to protect shorelines and restore critical fishery habitat. Finally, coastal wetland vegetation modifies shorelines in ways (e.g. peat accretion) that increase shoreline integrity over long timescales and thus provides a lasting coastal adaptation measure that can protect shorelines against accelerated sea level rise and more frequent storm inundation. We conclude that the shoreline protection paradigm still stands, but that gaps remain in our knowledge about the mechanistic and context-dependent aspects of shoreline protection.},

Both northern and southern canals had the remnant dredged spoil material returned to the canal, but the southern canal had additional sediment pumped in from a nearby lake. The water depth in the southern canal shallowed significantly from 1.2 to 0.4 m following backfilling and sediment addition, while the depth of the northern canal (which received no additional sediment) remained unchanged following backfilling. Neither site had complete soil restoration, but the former spoil areas of the northern canal showed greater restoration than the southern canal. The vegetation on the former spoil areas of the northern canal closely resembled that of the reference marsh, while the former spoil areas of the southern canal had species indicative of spoil banks and other elevated areas. After 3 years wetland vegetation was established on approximately 65\% of the former spoil areas at both sites and 20–25\% of the open water areas. Sediment addition to the southern canal raised costs by a factor of eight times compared to that of the northern canal. The results of this study document the restoration potential of both methods, but also show that backfilling without supplemental sediment additions can restore abandoned canals at a fraction of the cost of other methods.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of inundation frequency on carbohydrates, organic carbon ({OC}), inorganic carbon ({IC}) and nitrogen (N) in a marine and a brackish marsh. To gain insights into the origin of {OC} in the marshes we used monosaccharides as biomarkers. We studied soils in a marine and a brackish marsh along a gradient of inundation frequency. It was found that {TOC} and N stocks in soils of a marine and a brackish marsh increased with decreasing inundation frequency. Concentrations of carbohydrates were significantly higher in the topsoils of the marine marsh than of the brackish marsh. In the upper mid-zone of the marine marsh, which is inundated by the sea approximately 20-times a year, carbohydrate stocks were up to 2.4-times higher than in the upper mid-zone of the brackish marsh with the same inundation frequency. Differences in carbohydrate concentrations can be attributed to differences in the abundance of fine and medium roots in these soils. In the daily-inundated soils of both marshes we observed high hexose-to-pentose ratios, indicating a microbial origin of the carbohydrates, while the hexose-to-pentose ratios were significantly lower in the middle and upper zone of the two marshes, indicating a high proportion of plant-derived carbohydrates. This study shows that monosaccharides are useful biomarkers to explore the origin of {OM} in coastal soils.},

	abstract = {Global climate change is expected to increase the risks of coastal flood disasters due to accelerating sea level rise and increasing intensity and frequency of storm surges. Coastal marsh vegetation is considered, on the one hand, to increase resistance to a landward propagating flood wave, such as a storm surge, and hence to protect against flood disasters. On the other hand, coastal marsh vegetation is dying off at several places around the world due to accelerating sea level rise. Here we present hydrodynamic model simulations of flood attenuation by a tidal marsh, with particular focus on the effects of spatial patterns of vegetation die-off. It is shown that a same percentage of marsh die-off but occurring as different spatial patterns of marsh break-up has largely different effects on flood attenuation. Patches of die-off that are directly connected to tidal channels have a much greater effect on increased landward flood propagation, while a same percentage of marsh die-off, but occurring at inner marsh locations disconnected from tidal channels, has only a minor effect. This implies that a random pattern of up to 50\% of marsh die-off still provides a considerable flood attenuating effect. However with increasing percentage of random marsh die-off the flood attenuating effect decreases exponentially, since the chance for vegetation die-off occurring directly adjacent to tidal channels increases. This study demonstrates that tidal marsh die-off, which may increase with ongoing global change, is expected to have non-linear effects on reduced coastal protection against flood waves.},

Much of the erosion was caused by the offshore (ebb) flow of the ca. 5 m storm surge that formed spatially discrete scour features. Using aerial photography and repeat {LiDAR} data, we identify five types of scour features and describe the alongshore distribution in four flow environments. Type 1 scours are relatively small and compact features associated mainly with flow off a wide, vegetated (grasses, shrubs, trees) surface across a wide beach. Type 2 scours are large and branching forms associated mainly with flow that was channeled by streets or gaps between structures. Type 3 scours are large and blocky features associated with flow off a marsh surface, across a highway, which removed almost all beach sands from the surface. Type 4 scours are elongated, shore perpendicular channels associated with the same flow characteristics as Type 3 scours. Type 5 scours are elongated, shore-perpendicular features, sometimes branching, associated with flow through gaps in a destroyed shore protection structure. Repeat imagery indicates that many of the features persisted for at least seven months. Recent aerial photography indicates that aspects of some features remained evident more than three years after Ike's landfall.},

	abstract = {We measured the effect of wet meadow vegetation on the bank strength and failure mechanics of a meandering montane meadow stream, the South Fork of the Kern River at Monache Meadow, in California's Sierra Nevada. Streambanks colonized by ‘wet’ graminoid meadow vegetation were on average five times stronger than those colonized by ‘dry’ xeric meadow and scrub vegetation. Our measurements show that strength is correlated with vegetation density indicators, including stem counts, standing biomass per unit area, and the ratio of root mass to soil mass. Rushes appear better than sedges at stabilizing coarse bar surfaces, while sedges are far more effective at stabilizing actively eroding cut banks. Wet meadow floodplain vegetation creates a composite cut bank configuration (a cohesive layer overlying cohesionless materials) that erodes via cantilever failure. Field measurements and a geotechnical model of cantilever stability show that by increasing bank strength, wet meadow vegetation increases the thickness, width, and cohesiveness of a bank cantilever, which, in turn, increases the amount of time required to undermine, detach, and remove bank failure blocks. At Monache Meadow, it takes approximately four years to produce and remove a 1 m wide wet meadow bank block. Wet meadow vegetation limits bank migration rates by increasing bank strength, altering bank failure modes, and reducing bank failure frequency. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

A site along the Wadden Sea coast with extensive soft mud deposits, known as Zwarte Haan, was selected for more detailed laboratory and model analyses. Both field and laboratory measurements on sediment cores indicated strengths of a few {kPa}, i.e. slightly above the Liquid Limit. To assess the sensitivity of the mud deposits to liquefaction induced by incoming waves, we carried out cyclical triaxial tests in the laboratory on a series of samples taken from the field. The stresses prescribed were established from the wave heights and periods expected during storm conditions. However, even at stresses well beyond these values, the triaxial tests did not indicate full liquefaction of the mud samples; only some frictional losses were monitored.

These results are in contradiction with laboratory studies, where liquefaction has been measured frequently. However, our observations corroborate with other recent observations in literature, indicating that wave damping does not occur during a storm, but afterwards. It is hypothesized that fluid mud, dissipating wave energy, is formed by so-called auto-saturation and/or from deposition of mud eroded during that storm, and not from liquefaction during the storm. Wave damping then occurs through viscous dissipation in the fluid mud layers until these mud layers regain their initial strength through consolidation.

Next, we assessed the degree of wave damping to be expected at the beginning of a storm, when the bed is still unaffected and during/after storm conditions, when fluid mud is formed. We used the measured mud properties and those typical for fluid mud, as found in the literature. This assessment was done through simulations with a new version of {SWAN}, referred to as {SWAN}-mud. These simulations suggest significant wave damping under fluid mud conditions, but only 10\% damping at the beginning of the storm; moreover, the degree of wave damping over a muddy bed may decrease during the storm, as the soft mud deposits may be eroded by the waves.

Our analyses suggest that wave cannot liquefy soft mud beds under natural conditions, and that fluid mud layers, damping incoming waves by viscous dissipation, are formed from mud eroded by the shear flow induced by the waves' orbital motion. Note that in-situ pore water pressure measurements are required to corroborate this hypothesis.},

Biomass at the natural marsh was low compared to that of {otherSpartina} spp., but higher than values reported {forS}. foliosa in northern California. In sandy constructed marshes planted 5 and 10 years before this study,S. foliosa had lower belowground tissue N, lower N crop (\%N×biomass), and shallower roots than in the adjacent natural marsh. We took advantage of a 2-yr, large-scale fertilization project being performed in the older constructed marsh and examined biomass and N storage after N additions. Although there was a trend toward N accumulation with fertilization, N crop remained at approximately 50\% of natural marsh levels, unlike the large aboveground responses to N addition in our previous studies. Lower belowground reserves help to explain poor aerial growth in the created marshes and suggest the need for finer sediments (with greater potential for holding and supplying nutrients) to sustain (S. foliosa. While fine sediments are beginning to accumulate on the surface of the created marshes, vertical accretion is more likely to shift the plant community toward other species than to {enhanceS}. foliosa growth. We suggest salvaging and importing fine, organic marsh sediments or providing organic amendments to establish proper substrate conditions. Overexcavating and allowing fine sediments to accumulate remains an option, although the time scale is unpredictable due to the stochasticity of accretion events.},

	abstract = {Two major causes of salt marsh loss are vertical drowning, when sediment accumulation on the platform cannot keep vertical pace with sea level rise, and horizontal retreat, associated with wave-induced marsh boundary erosion. Despite these processes having been extensively documented and modeled, is unclear which loss modality dominates given a set of environmental parameters. A three-point dynamic model was developed to predict marsh loss as a function of sea level rise, allochthonous sediment supply, wind regime, tidal range, and marsh bank and mudflat erodability. Marsh horizontal and vertical evolution was found to respond in opposing ways to wave induced erosion processes. Marsh horizontal retreat was triggered by large mudflats, strong winds, high erodability of marsh bank and mudflat, whereas the opposite conditions acted to reduce the sediment supply to the marsh platform, promoting marsh loss to drowning. With low and moderate rates of sea level rise ({\textasciitilde} 5 mm/yr), retreat was found to be a more likely marsh loss modality than drowning. However, conditions associated with marsh retreat also increase the system resilience by transferring sediment on the marsh platform and preventing drowning. Our results suggest the use of a modular strategy for short-term marsh management: selectively protect extensive salt marsh regions by maintaining healthy vegetation on the platform, while allowing other areas to retreat, leveraging the natural resilience embedded in the lateral loss of marsh extent.},

The maximal rate of {SLR} that these ecosystems can tolerate depends partly on mineral sediment deposition, but the accumulation of organic matter is equally important for many wetlands. Plant productivity drives organic matter dynamics and is sensitive to global change factors, such as rising atmospheric {CO}2 concentration. It remains unknown how global change will influence organic mechanisms that determine future tidal wetland viability. Here, we present experimental evidence that plant response to elevated atmospheric [{CO}2] stimulates biogenic mechanisms of elevation gain in a brackish marsh. Elevated {CO}2 (ambient + 340 ppm) accelerated soil elevation gain by 3.9 mm yr−1 in this 2-year field study, an effect mediated by stimulation of below-ground plant productivity. Further, a companion greenhouse experiment revealed that the {CO}2 effect was enhanced under salinity and flooding conditions likely to accompany future {SLR}. Our results indicate that by stimulating biogenic contributions to marsh elevation, increases in the greenhouse gas, {CO}2, may paradoxically aid some coastal wetlands in counterbalancing rising seas.},

This can be difficult in areas where long-term drainage has eliminated wetland vegetation and significantly reduced the number of viable wetland plant seeds in the seed bank. This study of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wetland restoration sites in northern New York examines the effectiveness of transplanting wetland soil from small remnant wetlands in the drainage ditches to the area that becomes shallow marsh following reflooding. The results of two experiments are reported, including a small-scale study of transplantation techniques using small plots with treatments and controls established by hand, and a large-scale application of soil transplantation and site-preparation techniques using heavy equipment to establish large plots across entire wetland basins. In the small-scale study, the transplant plots had significantly lower wetland index values, indicating greater dominance of wetland plants, after one growing season but not after two. Transplant plots also had more wetland plant species and more wetland plant cover than natural control plots, and these differences persisted through the second growing season. Litter removal and soil disturbance also lowered the wetland index values and increased wetland plant species number and cover, but only for the first growing season. In the large-scale study, soil transplantation significantly increased both the number of species and the amount of cover of wetland plants and of plants valuable as wildlife food sources. Mowing and plowing treatments increased wetland plant establishment, but much less than soil transplantation, and plowing significantly increased the establishment of cattail (Typha spp.), an undesirable invasive species in small wildlife marshes. Soil transplantation should be a particularly effective technique for improving wetland plant establishment and limiting cattail encroachment in areas disturbed by dike construction.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: Control of emergent aquatic plants such as tule (Scirpus acutus Muhl.; Bigel.) is of direct interest to managers of surface waters in Western North America. Where conditions of water velocity and depth occur that permit this and similar species to colonize and grow, their clonal habit may restrict, or even block, open channels within several seasons after their establishment. Fortunately, sufficient flow depth and velocity naturally prevent these plants from growing into and blocking channels. We investigated physical constraints for tule stem growth with the ultimate intent to apply this knowledge in rehabilitating 60 miles of the diverted Owens River in Eastern California, presently choked with emergent growth. Bending stress resulting from hydrodynamic drag on tule stems was found to induce lodging; permanent deformation and consequent loss of function. The depth-velocity envelope describing this process (at 95 percent confidence) is {uD}/d= 12.8 where u = average velocity acting upon the stem (m/s), D = local depth of flow (m), and d = tule stem diameter at the point of attachment (m). Maintaining a discharge or reconfiguring a channel so this critical depth-velocity-stem diameter envelope is exceeded (predictable using flow models) through the summer growing period should prevent encroachment into an active channel.},

In the pioneer zone of salt marshes, species co-occur that differ widely in their growth strategies, and it is anticipated that these species act differently on incoming waves. In this field study we investigated, under different hydrodynamic forcing and tidal inundation levels, the wave attenuating capacity of two contrasting pioneer salt marsh species that co-occur in the Yangtze estuary, China. Our study shows that vegetation can reduce wave heights up to 80\% over a relatively short distance ({\textless}50 m). Our results further indicate that Spartina alterniflora is able to reduce hydrodynamic energy from waves to a larger extent than Scirpus mariqueter, and therefore has a larger ecosystem engineering capacity (2.5× higher on average). A higher standing biomass of S. alterniflora explained its higher wave attenuation at low water depths. Being much taller compared to S. mariqueter, S. alterniflora also attenuated waves more with increasing water depth. We conclude that knowledge about the engineering properties of salt marsh species is important to better understand wave attenuation by tidal wetlands and their possible role in coastal protection.},

A potential method of rehabilitating these systems is the addition of sediment-slurries to increase marsh surface elevation, thus ameliorating effects of excessive inundation. Although this technique is growing in popularity, the restoration of ecological function after sediment addition has received little attention. To determine if sediment subsidized salt marshes are functionally equivalent to natural marshes, we examined above- and belowground primary production in replicated restored marshes receiving four levels of sediment addition (29–42 cm North American Vertical Datum of 1988 [{NAVD} 88]) and in degraded and natural ambient marshes (4–22 cm {NAVD} 88). Moderate intensities of sediment-slurry addition, resulting in elevations at the mid to high intertidal zone (29–36 cm {NAVD} 88), restored ecological function to degraded salt marshes. Sediment additions significantly decreased flood duration and frequency and increased bulk density, resulting in greater soil drainage and redox potential and significantly lower phytotoxic sulfide concentrations. However, ecological function in the restored salt marsh showed a sediment addition threshold that was characterized by a decline in primary productivity in areas of excessive sediment addition and high elevation ({\textgreater}36 cm {NAVD} 88). Hence, the addition of intermediate levels of sediment to submerging salt marshes increased marsh surface elevation, ameliorated impacts of prolonged inundation, and increased primary productivity. However, too much sediment resulted in diminished ecological function that was equivalent to the submerged or degraded system.},

Despite its rapid formation by hydraulic dredging, this marsh was sedimentologically very similar to a nearby natural marsh. Root growth resulted in increased sediment cohesion, but compaction was less than 15\%; sediment water content even increased slightly during the first 2 years. Volatile solids were higher, especially in the upper 10 cm of the man-made marsh, as a result of plant litter accumulation. The measured elements (Ca, Fe, Mn, and Zn) in the pore water of both marshes showed no correlation with sediment-exchangeable phase concentrations. Rather, pore water concentrations were consistently correlated with concentrations from a 0.1 M hydroxylamine-hydrochloride and 0.01 M nitric acid extract, which represented easily reducible sediment phase constituents. This suggests that the slow mobilization of Mn and Ca, and possibly Fe and Zn, from the sediments of both marshes is not a simple exchange reaction process. Reducing conditions in the sediments, plant uptake, and partial recycling of these elements to the surface of the marsh via plant litter are important processes in their mobilization from marsh sediment.},

	abstract = {Wetlands are characterized by extremely high biodiversity and primary productivity (comparable to tropical rain forests), provide critical habitats for rare and endangered vegetation and animal species, and mediate the effects of floods and the action of the sea on the coast. A deep understanding of wetland system functioning cannot be acquired by simply reducing its dynamics to a collection of parts but requires the explicit description of wetland physical and ecological processes as fully interacting components. In fact, the complex spatial ecohydrological patterns characterizing wetland areas arise as a result of the coupled evolution of their ecological, hydrological, and morphological features. Here we examine observations of prominent spatial patterns in wetland vegetation and link them to the relevant hydrological and ecological processes. We describe the limitations to vegetation development due to scarce soil oxygen availability and implement a mathematical model, based on Richards' equation, coupling subsurface water flow and plant water uptake in a tidal salt marsh. The soil aeration patterns arising from such interactions highlight the central role of vegetation in increasing soil aeration, possibly inducing the establishment of a permanently aerated soil layer (in spite of tidal flooding), and the influence of different soil characteristics on soil oxygen availability. Finally, we discuss how ecohydrological interactions can contribute to explain patterns of vegetation colonization and spatial heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {We analyzed the effects of various levels of sediment-slurry addition on the restoration of the macroinvertebrate community and its related habitat (i.e., sediment and vegetation) 7 years after application to a subsided Louisiana salt marsh affected by sudden marsh dieback. Moderate sediment additions restored macroinvertebrate species richness, diversity, density, and total biomass to levels equivalent to those in reference marshes, although individual species and taxa had variable recovery depending on treatment-level. Total aboveground plant biomass and live Spartina alterniflora biomass, stem density and height were equivalent to those in reference marshes. In contrast, total belowground biomass had not yet reached equivalency with reference marshes. Although moderate sediment application created conditions that were ecologically equivalent with reference marshes for most macroinvertebrate and plant variables, degraded areas that received high sediment addition had impaired recovery across all metrics, even 7 years after sediment application. Thus, when sediment-slurries are applied to proper elevations, the macroinvertebrate community, as well as aboveground marsh vegetation, can recover to reference conditions. However, too much sediment impairs recovery. Consequently, greater consideration must be given to establishing suitable post-construction marsh elevations to insure successful ecosystem restoration.},

	abstract = {Marsh creation is currently receiving wide attention in the United States as an important tool for mitigating the impacts of development in coastal wetlands. The perception that there is no net loss in valuable coastal wetlands when development is mitigated by the creation of man-made marshes can have a substantial impact on the permitting and decision-making processes. The effective result may be the trading of natural salt marshes for man-made marshes. Techniques for marsh creation were developed by the {US} Army Corps of Engineers to enhance and stabilize dredge spoil materials. Most research sponsored by the Corps has been directed at determining whether these goals have been accomplished. A survey of the research indicates that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that man-made marshes function like natural salt marshes or provide the important values of natural marshes. It is necessary, therefore, for decision-makers to understand the limitations of present knowledge about man-made marshes, realistically evaluate the trade-offs involved, and relegate mitigation to its proper role in the permitting process—post facto conditions imposed on developments that clearly meet state qualifications and policies.},

A simple model is presented here to couple the hydrologic and vegetation dynamics via transpiration and ecosystem carrying capacity. The simulation results portray possible competition outcomes between plant species having different survival strategies in response to the fluctuating soil moisture and water tables under different rainfall conditions. Long-range correlations in the dynamics were detected in several of the key variables of wetland ecosystems, as the result of their dependence on the long- memory structure of the water table. The statistical structure of the modeled water table fluctuations is found to be similar to that obtained from a real case study, validating the ability of the model in capturing water table dynamics and suggesting its potential toward the quantification of the long-term dynamics of wetland vegetation.},

	abstract = {We examined the effects of seasonal salinity changes on sediment ammonium ({NH}4 +) adsorption and exchange across the sediment–water interface in the Parker River Estuary, by means of seasonal field sampling, laboratory adsorption experiments, and modeling. The fraction of dissolved {NH}4 + relative to adsorbed {NH}4 + in oligohaline sediments rose significantly with increased pore water salinity over the season. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that small (∼3) increases in salinity from freshwater conditions had the greatest effect on {NH}4 + adsorption by reducing the exchangeable pool from 69\% to 14\% of the total {NH}4 + in the upper estuary sediments that experience large (0–20) seasonal salinity shifts. {NH}4 + dynamics did not appear to be significantly affected by salinity in sediments of the lower estuary where salinities under 10 were not measured. We further assessed the importance of salinity-mediated desorption by constructing a simple mechanistic numerical model for pore water chloride and {NH}4 + diffusion for sediments of the upper estuary. The model predicted pore water salinity and {NH}4 + profiles that fit measured profiles very well and described a seasonal pattern of {NH}4 + flux from the sediment that was significantly affected by salinity. The model demonstrated that changes in salinity on several timescales (tidally, seasonally, and annually) can significantly alter the magnitude and timing of {NH}4 + release from the sediments. Salinity-mediated desorption and fluxes of {NH}4 + from sediments in the upper estuary can be of similar magnitude to rates of organic nitrogen mineralization and may therefore be important in supporting estuarine productivity when watershed inputs of N are low.},

	abstract = {Crevasse splay environments provide a mesocosm for evaluating wetland formation and maintenance processes on a decadal time scale. Site elevation, water levels, vertical accretion, elevation change, shallow subsidence, and plant biomass were measured at five habitats along an elevation gradient to evaluate wetland formation and development in Brant Pass Splay; an active crevasse splay of the Balize delta of the Mississippi River. The processes of vertical development (vertical accretion, elevation change, and shallow subsidence) were measured with the surface elevation table–marker horizon method. There were three distinct stages to the accrual of elevation capital and wetland formation in the splay: sediment infilling, vegetative colonization, and development of a mature wetland community. Accretion, elevation gain, and shallow subsidence all decreased by an order of magnitude from the open water (lowest elevation) to the forest (highest elevation) habitats. Vegetative colonization occurred within the first growing season following emergence of the mud surface. An explosively high rate of below-ground production quickly stabilized the loosely consolidated sub-aerial sediments. After emergent vegetation colonization, vertical development slowed and maintenance of marsh elevation was driven both by sediment trapping by the vegetation and accumulation of plant organic matter in the soil. Continued vertical development and survival of the marsh then depended on the health and productivity of the plant community. The process of delta wetland formation is both complex and nonlinear. Determining the dynamics of wetland formation will help in understanding the processes driving the past building of the delta and in developing models for restoring degraded wetlands in the Mississippi River delta and other deltas around the world.},

	abstract = {Restoration of river deltas involves diverting sediment and water from major channels into adjoining drowned areas, where the sediment can build new land and provide a platform for regenerating wetland ecosystems. Except for local engineered structures at the points of diversion, restoration mainly relies on natural delta-building processes. Present understanding of such processes is sufficient to provide a basis for determining the feasibility of restoration projects through quantitative estimates of land-building rates and sustainable wetland area under different scenarios of sediment supply, subsidence, and sea-level rise. We are not yet to the point of being able to predict the evolution of a restored delta in detail. Predictions of delta evolution are based on field studies of active deltas, deltas in mine-tailings ponds, experimental deltas, and countless natural experiments contained in the stratigraphic record. These studies provide input for a variety of mechanistic delta models, ranging from radially averaged formulations to more detailed models that can resolve channels, topography, and ecosystem processes. Especially exciting areas for future research include understanding the mechanisms by which deltaic channel networks self-organize, grow, and distribute sediment and nutrients over the delta surface and coupling these to ecosystem processes, especially the interplay of topography, network geometry, and ecosystem dynamics.},

	abstract = {Contrasting soil conditions caused by different inundation frequenciesrequire different root growth strategies along the elevational gradient ofcoastal salt marshes. The objective of this study was to examine (1) if rootlifespan was shorter in Elymus pycnanthus, a relativelyfast-growing competitive species dominating high marshes, than {inSpartina} anglica, a relatively slow-growingstress-tolerating species dominating low marshes, and (2) if the species withlonger lifespan had higher tissue density (g cm−3) and lowerspecific root length (m g−1) than the species with shorterlifespan. Root production and mortality rates were established by samplingrootsin in-growth cores, and using triphenyltetrazolium chloride ({TTC}) staining todistinguish vital from dead roots. Root lifespan was estimated by dividing theliving root biomass (Elymus: 36 gm−2, Spartina: 100 gm−2) by root production (Elymus:0.28 g day−1 m−2,Spartina: 0.25 g day−1m−2) or root mortality rates(Elymus: 0.42–0.53 g day−1m−2). Spartina did not exhibitsubstantial mortality. Despite the present method only yielding rough estimatesof average root lifespan, it is evident that root longevity is much shorter {inElymus} than in Spartina. Rootlifespanranged between 10–19 weeks for Elymus but was closeto 1 year in Spartina, indicating {thatElymus} replaces it's roots continuously throughout thegrowing season, whereas Spartina maintains its roots overthe growing season. Fine roots of Elymus had slightlylowertissue density (0.094) than those of Spartina (0.139),whereas coarse roots of Elymus {andSpartina} had similar tissue density (0.100 gcm−3). Fine roots of Elymus {andSpartina} had similar specific root length (195 mg−1). However, coarse roots {ofElymus} (50 m g−1) had higherspecific root length than those of Spartina (20 mg−1) due to having smaller root diameter(Elymus: 548 μm,Spartina: 961 μm). We conclude thatpresentobservations on Elymus and Spartinasupport our first hypothesis that the ‘competitive’ species fromthehigh marsh had short-lived roots compared to the'stress-tolerating'species from the low marsh. However, our result provide only weak support forthe existence of a positive correlation between root longevity and tissuedensity and a negative correlation between root longevity and specific rootlength.},

In order to assess the impact of tidal flow restriction on marsh sedimentation processes, sediment cores were collected from flow-restricted salt marshes along the Connecticut coast of Long Island Sound. Cores were also collected from unrestricted reference marshes and from a marsh that had been previously restricted but was restored to fuller tidal flushing in the 1970's. High bulk densities and low C and N concentrations were found at depth in the restricted marsh cores, which we attribute to a period of organic matter oxidation, sediment compaction, and marsh surface subsidence upon installation of flow restrictions (between 100 and 200 years before the present, depending on the marsh). Recent sedimentation rates at the restricted marshes (as determined by $^{\textrm{137}}$ Cs and $^{\textrm{210}}$ Pb dating) were positive and averaged 78\% ($^{\textrm{137}}$ Cs) and 50\% ($^{\textrm{210}}$ Pb) of reference marsh sedimentation rates. The accumulation of inorganic sediment was similar at the restricted and reference marshes, perhaps because of the seasonal operation of the tide gates, while organic sediment accretion (and pore space) was significantly lower in the restricted marshes, perhaps because of higher decomposition rates. Sedimentation rates at the restored marsh were significantly higher than at the reference marshes. This marsh has responded to the higher water levels resulting from restoration by a rapid increase in marsh surface elevation.},

	abstract = {Coastal regions present a complex dynamic web of natural and human related processes. Although coastal zones are narrow areas extending a few kilometres on either side of the shoreline, and occupying small strip of ocean and land, they play a very important role as they account for nearly a quarter of all oceanic biological production, which in turn supplies approximately 80\% of the world¿s fish. About 60\% of the human population lives in the coastal zone, and around 70\% of big cities are placed in this narrow area. Concomitantly, more than 90\% of the pollutants generated by human economic activities end up in the coastal zone.In order to reach satisfactory solutions for the demands imposed on the coastal areas and the protection of its environment, one needs to understand very different aspects and their interaction. The problems are essentially interdisciplinary and scientists need to be able to exchange ideas with colleagues from other disciplines with a variety of different experiences. Thus, an acceleration of research is needed to improve the quality of the coastal processes prediction, together with an adequate level of scepticism about the model results and a continuous comparison with well-documented case studies and field experiments. This is the reason why, after the successful experience of the first Conference in Malta, the Wessex Institute of Technology, the University Parthenope of Naples and the University of Las Palmas, Gran Canaria decided to convene a second International Conference in Coastal Processes (of which this book comprises the edited papers) grouped into the following topics: Coastal Management; Coastal Processes and {GIS}; Coastal Geomorphology; Extreme Events and Sea Level Rise; Coastal Processes and Navigation; Sediment Transport and Erosion; Interaction between Coastal Defences and Processes; Pollution and dispersion; Hydrodynamic Forces.},

	abstract = {Root production influences a range of belowground processes, such as soil accretion, carbon sequestration and nutrient acquisition. Here, we measured biomass and root production of mangroves surrounding a karstic oligotrophic lagoon that spans a nutrient and salinity gradient. We also measured forest structure and soil physicochemical conditions (salinity, bulk density, carbon, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) in order to determine factors associated with root production. We tested the following hypotheses: 1) root biomass and production increase at low soil P and N in order to maximize resource utilization, and 2) root biomass and production increase with high interstitial salinity. Root biomass (947–3,040 g m−2) and production (0.46–1.85 g m−2 day−1) increased where soil P and interstitial salinity were relatively high. Thus, we rejected the first hypothesis and confirmed the second. The larger root fraction (5–20 mm) was the major contributor to root biomass and production. Our findings suggest that root production and thus capacity for belowground carbon storage in karstic regions, where P is often limiting, is greater where interstitial salinity and P are higher. This contrasts with past assessments indicating that P-deficiency stimulates root growth, suggesting wide variation in belowground responses in mangroves.},

	abstract = {Vegetation in rivers, estuaries and coastal areas is often submerged and highly flexible. The study of its interaction with the ambient flow environment is important for the determination of the discharge capacity, morphological characteristics and ecological conditions of the water course where it grows. In this work the hydrodynamics of submerged flexible vegetation with or without foliage is investigated by using a 3D numerical model. Flexible vegetation is modeled by momentum sink terms, with the velocity-dependent stem height determined by a large deflection analysis which is more accurate than the previously used small deflection analysis. The effect of foliage on flow resistance is expressed in terms of the change in the product of the drag coefficient and the projected area, which is supported by available experimental data. The computed results show that the vertical profiles of the mean horizontal velocity and the vertical Reynolds shear stress are correctly simulated. The temporal variation of the stem deflection follows closely that of the velocity and the ‘Honami’ phenomenon can be reproduced. The numerical simulations also confirm that the flexibility of vegetation decreases both the vegetation-induced flow resistance force and the vertical Reynolds shear stress, while the presence of foliage further enhances these reduction effects.},

Most of the extensive prehistoric salt marsh plains within the tidal creek network also support mixed assemblages of S. pacifica, but high marsh zones along tidal creek banks support nearly continuous linear stands of gumplant (Grindelia stricta) and saltgrass (Distichlis spicata) with more diverse salt marsh forb assemblages. Salt pans with submerged wigeongrass (Ruppia maritima) are scarce, local, and small. The landward edge of the tidal marsh forms rare examples of ecotones with adjacent terrestrial vegetation, including those of alluvial valleys (riparian scrub and woodland, freshwater marsh, sedge-rush meadows) and hillslope grassland and oak woodland vegetation. Narrow high tidal marsh ecotones bordering terrestrial grasslands are locally dominated by creeping wildrye (Elymus triticoides) and Baltic rush (Juncus balticus), mostly on south-facing slopes. Brackish tidal marsh ecotones above ordinary high tides are associated with freshwater discharges from groundwater and surface flows. Brackish marsh ecotones support large clonal stands of sedge, bulrush, and rush vegetation (Carex praegracilis, C. barbarae, Bolboschoenus maritimus, Juncus phaeocephalus, Schoenoplectus acutus), intergrading with terrestrial freshwater wetlands and salt marsh. The terrestrial ecotone assemblages at China Camp are comparable with those of other prehistoric tidal marshes in the San Francisco Estuary, but China Camp lacks most native clonal perennial Asteraceae and halophytic annual forbs of the region’s remnant high tidal marsh ecotones. Few globally rare salt marsh plant populations have been reported from China Camp within the National Estuarine Research Reserve and State Park boundaries, but some species regionally uncommon in San Francisco Bay tidal marshes occur. To date, non-native tidal marsh plant invasions have been relatively minor and localized within China Camp.},

	abstract = {We used a combined field and modeling approach to estimate the potential for submergence for one rapidly deteriorating (Bayou Chitigue Marsh) and one apparently stable (Old Oyster Bayou Marsh) saltmarsh wetland in coastal Louisiana, given two eustatic sea level rise scenarios: the current rate (0.15 cm year−1); and the central value predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (48 cm by the year 2100). We also used the model to determine what processes were most critical for maintaining and influencing salt marsh elevation including, mineral matter deposition, organic matter production, shallow subsidence (organic matter decomposition + primary sediment compaction), deep subsidence, and sediment pulsing events (e.g., hurricanes). Eight years of field measurements from feldspar marker horizons and surface elevation tables revealed that the rates of vertical accretion at the Bayou Chitigue Marsh were high (2.26 (0.09) cm yr−1 (mean ± {SE})) because the marsh exists at the lower end of the tidal range. The rate of shallow subsidence was also high (2.04 (0.1) cm yr−1), resulting in little net elevation gain (0.22 (0.06) cm yr−1). In contrast, vertical accretion at the Old Oyster Bayou Marsh, which is 10 cm higher in elevation, was 0.48 (0.09) cm yr−1. However, there was a net elevation gain of 0.36 (0.08) cm yr−1 because there was no significant shallow subsidence. When these rates of elevation gain were compared to rates of relative sea level rise (deep subsidence plus eustatic sea level rise), both sites showed a net elevation deficit although the Bayou Chitigue site was subsiding at approximately twice the rate of the Old Oyster Bayou site (1.1 cm yr−1 versus 0.49 cm yr−1 respectively). These field data were used to modify, initialize, and calibrate a previously published wetland soil development model that simulates primary production and mineral matter deposition as, feedback functions of elevation. Sensitivity analyses revealed that wetland elevation was most sensitive to changes in the rates of deep subsidence, a model forcing function that is difficult to measure in the field and for which estimates in the literature vary widely. The model also revealed that, given both the current rate of sea level rise and the central value estimate, surface elevation at both sites would fall below mean sea level over the next 100 years. Although these results were in agreement with the field study, they contradicted long term observations that the Old Oyster Bayou site has been in equilibrium with sea level for at least the past 50 years. Further simulations showed that the elevation at the Old Oyster Bayou site could keep pace with current rates of sea level rise if either a lower rate for deep subsidence was used as a forcing function, or if a periodic sediment pulsing function (e.g., from hurricanes) was programmed into the model.},

On-site experiments with wheat and alfalfa fields have allowed us to quantify the motion of a large set of plants subject to wind, using an image-correlation technique. The coherent part of the waving motion is extracted by a bi-orthogonal decomposition of the
spatio-temporal velocity field of the crop surface. It is shown that the corresponding space and time features cannot be explained using
predictions from the mixing-layer analogy of wind above canopies, which is the most common model for perturbations in this environment. We show that the plant bending stiffness plays an important role in the
frequency and wavelength selection for the coherent motion of the canopy. A fully coupled model, where the wind fluctuations and the plant dynamics interact through a drag term, is then proposed. This model allows us to demonstrate a lock-in mechanism, similar in principle to what is found in vortex-induced vibration, whereby the frequency of the instability deviates from its expected value when approaching the natural frequency of the oscillating medium. This finding is then compared with data from on-site experiments, and good agreement, in both the frequency and wavelength of the propagating patterns observed on the canopy surface, is found.},

The movement of plant in turn may affect the turbulent flow field via resistance to flow, turbulence production and dissipation. The present study treats the interaction of turbulent flow and honami employing 2D-{LES}, in which a concept of “plant grid” is used to treat the movement of plant in addition to the ordinary {LES} grid. The drag due to the plant is formulated in proportion to the square of the relative velocity between flow and motion of plant in momentum equations for turbulent flow field. In transport equation of turbulent energy, the additional terms of turbulent production and dissipation due to motion of plant are included. The computational result indicates that the honami reduces the periodicity of vortex generation, and the velocity fluctuation, therefore, becomes irregular if compared with the case for which the plant is assumed to be rigid. It was also found that the honami repeats generation and disappearance.},

	abstract = {The flow of water in wetlands may exert significant influence on wetland biogeochemistry, and specifically interfacial gas exchange. Measuring currents in wetlands requires caution. The acoustic Doppler velocimeter ({ADV}) is widely used for the characterization of water flow and turbulence. However, deployment of {ADVs} in low-flow environments is hampered by a unique source of bias related to the {ADV}'s mode of operation. The extent of this bias is revealed by Particle image velocimetry ({PIV}) measurements of an {ADV} operating in quiescent fluid. Image-based flow measurement techniques such as {PIV} may provide improved accuracy in low-flow environments like wetlands. Such techniques were applied to observe wind-driven flows in a wetland with emergent vegetation and investigate the effects of the wind shear on gas transfer across the air-water interface. Wind speed is the parameter most often used to model interfacial gas exchange in other aquatic environments. In wetlands with emergent vegetation, the emergent vegetation will attenuate wind speed above the water surface, modify fluid shear at the water surface, and influence stirring beneath the water surface. Direct measurements of gas transfer in a model wetland in the laboratory indicated that unless wind speeds are extreme, interfacial gas transfer in wetlands is typically dominated by another physical force: surface cooling-induced thermal convection. In an application of these lab results, gas transfer across the air-water interface due to thermal convection in the water column is shown to account for a sizable portion of total methane fluxes from a restored marsh in California's Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.},

	abstract = {Our study of sediment accretion rates from four low tidal-range sites along the Gulf of Mexico does not support previous hypotheses concerning the relationship between tidal range and vertical accretion rates. The addition of our data to an earlier data set decreased the correlation between these variables, and all but one of our low-tidal range sites had positive accretion rates, contradicting previous studies which have predicted that low tidal-range sites would have negative net accretion rates. Additionally, in transects across the marsh, accretion rates decreased from low- to high- marsh stations; however, this appeared to be caused by changes in rates of organic matter accumulation, not mineral matter accumulation, as has been proposed in previous studies. Vertical accretion rates were more strongly correlated with organic matter accumulation rates than mineral matter accumulation rates, confirming previous studies which indicated the important role of sediment organic matter in determining sediment structure. These results do not imply that mineral matter is unimportant in maintaining the elevation of the marsh; mineral matter input affects organic matter production and sediment bulk density. There was little correlation between mineral and organic matter accumulation rates, with average organic matter accumulation rates for each site having little variation compared to the variation in mineral matter accumulation rates. This result supports a previous hypothesis that there may be a limit to annual rates of organic matter accumulation. Finally, the study indicates that the negative net accretion rates documented in Louisiana are not typical of other Gulf coast wetlands.},

For other cases approximations leading to an upper and a lower estimate of the frequency of oscillation ω can be derived. For the limiting case of ω = 0, the differential equations are identical with Greenhill's equations for the stability against Euler buckling of slender poles. To illustrate, the oscillation frequencies of 25 spruce trees (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) were compared with those calculated on the basis of their morphology, their density and their static elasticity modulus. For Arundo donax L. and Cyperus alternifolius L. the observed oscillation frequency was used in turn to calculate the dynamic elasticity modulus, which was compared with that determined in three–point bending. Oscillation damping was observed for A. donax and C. alternifolius for plants' stems with and without leaves or inflorescence. In C. alternifolius the difference can be attributed to the aerodynamic resistance of the leaves, whereas in A. donax structural damping in addition plays a major role.},

Being an important part of its mother disciplines, Hydrodynamics of Aquatic Ecosystems deals with two key interconnected issues: (i) physical interactions between flow and organisms (e.g. due to an interplay between flow-induced forces and reaction forces generated by organisms) and (ii) ecologically relevant mass-transfer-uptake processes (e.g. due to molecular and turbulent diffusion).

Fifty-three infants, randomized into one of four treatment groups, received 8 ml. per kilogram of a solution containing either (A) glucose in water, (B) salt-poor albumin, (C) {NaHCO}3, or (D) a combination of albumin and {NaHCO}3. After the initial infusion, the babies received no colloid or alkali solutions until 4 hours of age. We managed them supportively with warmth, appropriate oxygen administration, isotonic fluid infusion, and close monitoring. Among the infants who received alkali, 14 of 26 acquired the respiratory distress syndrome ({RDS}), 11 died, and four had intracranial hemorrhage. Among babies who received no alkali, {RDS} occurred in 11 of 27, 5 died, and none had intracranial hemorrhage. These results do not support the common practice of rapidly infusing {NaHCO}3 into high-risk, premature infants, and they suggest that the early management of such infants needs renewed critical evaluation.},

The study is based on experiments conducted in a laboratory flume using single specimens of Ranunculus penicillatus, Fontinalis antipyretica, Myriophyllum alterniflorum, and Callitriche stagnalis. A significant correlation between drag fluctuations, plant movements, and upstream turbulence was found. The data also revealed that the plants in general exhibited spatial flapping-like motion, with the propagation velocity of perturbations along the plant being approximately constant and comparable to the upstream flow velocity. The analysis of statistical moments, spectra, cross-correlations, and coherence functions provided strong support to the conclusion that the dynamic reconfiguration directly affects the drag force exerted on the plants, in addition to the effect of the upstream turbulence.},

This paper explores the hydraulic behavior of deep zones to provide a better understanding of their potential benefit. First, we use a bench-scale model to show that recirculation within a deep zone is likely under field conditions. Recirculation is believed to provide a mechanism for mixing. We then use a mathematical model to explore the effect on the outlet concentration of replacing a section of a wetland marsh with a deep zone that provides mixing. We observe that even when deep zones have a lower volumetric removal rate than the marsh areas they replace, the presence of a deep zone may decrease the outlet concentration and hence improve the performance of the wetland segment.},

Primary productivity is an important function and indicator of success for salt marsh creation and restoration projects. The aim of this study was to determine whether the aboveground and belowground productivity of the dominant salt marsh {grassSpartina} alterniflora in created marshes in southwest Louisiana began to approximate productivity levels in natural marshes, over time. Net annual aboveground primary productivity ({NAPP}) was measured by a harvest technique, while the ingrowth core method was used to estimate net annual belowground primary productivity ({NBPP}). {NAPP} levels were similar to those found in other, Louisiana salt marshes, while {NBPP} levels were similar to or higher than the reported range {forS}. alterniflora studied along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. {NAPP} tended to decrease as the created marshes aged, but the levels in the oldest, 19 year old, created marsh were still well above values measured in the, natural marshes. It was estimated that it would take 35 yr after marsh creation for {NAPP} in the created marshes to become equivalent to that in natural marshes. {NBPP} in the created marshes became equivalent to levels found in the natural marshes after 6–8 yr, but then belowground production increased with marsh age, reaching an asymptote that surpassed natural marsh levels. Equivalency in primary productivity has not been reached in these marshes. Elevation also affected productivity, as higher elevational sites with greater topographic heterogeneity had significantly lower aboveground and belowground biomass levels than those with elevations closer to mean sea level. This underscores the need to construct marshes so that their mean elevation and degree of topographic heterogeneity are similar to natural marshes.},

	abstract = {We monitored wetland biomass, decomposition, hydrology, and soil porewater chemistry at the Breton Sound estuary, which receives Mississippi River water from the Caernarvon river diversion structure. The estuary was in the direct path of hurricane Katrina in 2005, which caused a dramatic loss of wetlands in the upper basin. From March 2006 to October 2007, we made duplicate measurements at three distance classes from the diversion structure along the estuarine gradient as well as at a reference area, designated Near (N1\&2), Mid (M1\&2), Far (F1\&2), and Ref (R1\&2). Above- and belowground live biomass, porewater nutrients ({NOx}, {NH}4, and {PO}4), salinity, sulfide, and soil Eh were measured every 2 months. Water level was monitored with gauges. Above- and belowground decomposition was measured using the litterbag (both) and cotton strip (belowground only) methods. Analysis of porewater parameters showed that stress factors affecting biomass production (porewater salinity, sulfide, flooding, and redox potential) were generally low to moderate, while measurable porewater nutrient concentrations occurred at all sites. Aboveground end of season live ({EOSL}) standing crop in October ranged from 423 g/m2 at site M2 to 1,515 at site F1, and was significantly greater at site N1 than at sites N2, M1, or M2. Aboveground {EOSL} biomass during this study was significantly lower than previously measured in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Peak belowground biomass ranged from 8,315 g/m2 at site R2 to 17,890 g/m2 at site N1, which is among the highest reported in the literature, and there were significant increases throughout the study, suggesting recovery from hurricane Katrina. The decomposition bag data did not indicate any significant differences; however, the cotton strip decomposition rate was significantly lower at the lowest depth. Wetland surface vertical accretion ranged from 0.49 cm/year at N2 to 1.24 cm/year at N1, with site N1 significantly greater than N2, M1, F2, and R1, and site N2 significantly less than all other sites except site R1. These findings show that marsh productivity and stability is related to a number of factors and no one factor can explain the impacts of the hurricanes.},

Environmental parameters (sediment redox potential, and water, organic carbon and silt/clay contents) and univariate community attributes (total individuals and species, diversity, evenness and biomass) at the recharge sites had attained reference levels at two schemes while assemblages differed significantly in terms of species composition at all three schemes. While trophic group proportionality had re-established at one scheme, an increased grazer dominance was apparent at another while the proportion of sub-surface deposit feeders decreased at the third. Total individuals and species number of the developing communities were negatively correlated with sediment redox potential at 4 cm and \% silt/clay, respectively.

Genomics research has uncovered the diversity of nitrogen metabolism strategies in phytoplankton and bacterioplankton. The elemental ratios of nutrients in biological material are more flexible than previously believed, with implications for vertical export of carbon and associated nutrients to the deep ocean. Estimates of nitrogen fixation and denitrification continue to be modified, and anaerobic ammonia oxidation has been identified as a new process involved in denitrification in oxygen minimum zones.

	abstract = {The goal of this research was to study the impact of the application rate of biosolids from municipal sewage sludge on soil functionality. The biosolids originated from the composting of aerobic or anaerobic municipal sewage sludge with rice husk in the ratio 1/1 v/v. The products were applied at increasing doses, 50 (1 ×), 150 (3 ×), and 300 (6 ×) mg N kg− 1ds, on a sandy loam soil. In order to highlight their impact on soil properties and evaluate their possible deleterious effects, soil functional parameters (soil microbial biomass, soil enzyme activities, and soil bacterial population) were used. Outcomes showed that the increase of the application rate had significant impact on microbial biomass carbon, which increased by 5\%, 9\% and 21\% in 1 ×, 3 × and 6 × with respect to the untreated soil. Biosolid application rate influenced soil enzyme activities, such as β-glucosidase, dehydrogenase, protease and alkaline phosphomonoesterase which sharply increased at 3 × and 6 ×, especially in the soils amended with the aerobic biosolid. Soil total bacterial population proved to be stable and not affected, at any dose, by biosolid addition.
Concerning total trace metals, no dose effect was registered, as their concentrations were the same for each dose and treatment; on the contrary, available copper diminished with application rate. On the whole, soil functionality was not negatively affected by biosolid application.},

	abstract = {Although the concept of self-design is frequently employed in restoration, reestablishment of primary physical drivers does not always result in a restored ecosystem having the desired ecological functions that support system resilience and stability. We investigated the use of a primary environmental driver in coastal salt marshes, sediment availability, as a means of promoting the resilience and stability of submerging deltaic salt marshes, which are rapidly subsiding due to natural and human-induced processes. We conducted a disturbance–recovery experiment across a gradient of sediment slurry addition to assess the roles of sediment elevation and soil physico-chemical characteristics on vegetation resilience and stability in two restored salt marshes of differing age (a 15-year-old site and a 5-year-old site). Salt marshes that received moderate intensities of sediment slurry addition with elevations at the mid to high intertidal zone (2–11 cm above local mean sea level; {MSL}) were more resilient than natural marshes. The primary regulator of enhanced resilience and stability in the restored marshes was the alleviation of flooding stress observed in the natural, unsubsidized marsh. However, stability reached a sediment addition threshold, at an elevation of 11 cm above {MSL}, with decreasing stability in marshes above this elevation. Declines in resilience and stability above the sediment addition threshold were principally influenced by relatively dry conditions that resulted from insufficient and infrequent flooding at high elevations. Although the older restored marsh has subsided over time, areas receiving too much sediment still had limited stability 15 years later, emphasizing the importance of applying the appropriate amount of sediment to the marsh. In contrast, treated marshes with elevations 2–11 cm above {MSL} were still more resilient than the natural marsh 15 years after restoration, illustrating that when performed correctly, sediment slurry addition can be a sustainable restoration technique.},

We use a point model of the coupled elevation–vegetation dynamics, which retains the description of the chief processes shaping these systems. We observe that salt marshes exposed to large tidal ranges are more stable, and therefore more resilient to increasing rates of {RSLR}, than marshes subjected to low tidal ranges. Furthermore, subtidal platforms in macrotidal systems are less exposed to wind-induced erosion processes than their counterparts in systems with smaller tidal fluctuations. Notably, we find that vegetation crucially affects both the equilibrium marsh elevation, through dissipation of wind waves and organic accumulation, and marsh resilience to accelerations in {RSLR} rates. Moreover, the biomass production as a function of elevation associated with the presence of different vegetation species, as opposed to mono-specific vegetation covers, increases marsh stability and resilience in the face of increasing rates of {RSLR}. Finally, our results show that the existence and stability of equilibrium states fundamentally depend on the local wind and tidal regime, even within the same tidal system, with important biogeomorphic implications. In summary, our model analyses of physical and biological controls of tidal system dynamics highlight the importance of accounting for biogeomorphic feedback to obtain realistic representations of the system dynamics in response to climatic changes.

	abstract = {Invasive species frequently degrade habitats, disturb ecosystem processes, and can increase the likelihood of extinction of imperiled populations. However, novel or enhanced functions provided by invading species may reduce the impact of processes that limit populations. It is important to recognize how invasive species benefit endangered species to determine overall effects on sensitive ecosystems. For example, since the 1990s, hybrid Spartina (Spartina foliosa × alterniflora) has expanded throughout South San Francisco Bay, {USA}, supplanting native vegetation and invading mudflats. The endangered California clapper rail (Rallus longirostris obsoletus) uses the tall, dense hybrid Spartina for cover and nesting, but the effects of hybrid Spartina on clapper rail survival was unknown. We estimated survival rates of 108 radio-marked California clapper rails in South San Francisco Bay from January 2007 to March 2010, a period of extensive hybrid Spartina eradication, with Kaplan–Meier product limit estimators. Clapper rail survival patterns were consistent with hybrid Spartina providing increased refuge cover from predators during tidal extremes which flood native vegetation, particularly during the winter when the vegetation senesces. Model averaged annual survival rates within hybrid Spartina dominated marshes before eradication (Ŝ = 0.466) were greater than the same marshes posttreatment (Ŝ = 0.275) and a marsh dominated by native vegetation (Ŝ = 0.272). However, models with and without marsh treatment as explanatory factor for survival rates had nearly equivalent support in the observed data, lending ambiguity as to whether hybrid Spartina facilitated greater survival rates than native marshland. Conservation actions to aid in recovery of this endangered species should recognize the importance of available of high tide refugia, particularly in light of invasive species eradication programs and projections of future sea-level rise.},

	abstract = {Flow and sedimentation around patches of vegetation are important to landscape evolution, and a better understanding of these processes would facilitate more effective river restoration and wetlands engineering. In wetlands and channels, patches of vegetation are rarely isolated and neighboring patches influence one another during their development. In this experimental study, an adjacent pair of emergent vegetation patches were modeled by circular arrays of cylinders with their centers aligned in a direction that was perpendicular to the flow direction. The flow and deposition patterns behind the pair of patches were measured for two stem densities and for different patch separations (gap widths). The wake pattern immediately behind each individual patch was similar to that observed behind an isolated patch, with a velocity minimum directly behind each patch that produced a well-defined region of enhanced deposition in line with the patch. For all gap widths (Δ), the velocity on the centerline between the patches (Uc) was elevated to a peak velocity Umax that persisted over a distance Lj. Although Umax was not a function of Δ, Lj decreased with decreasing Δ. Beyond L\_j, the wakes merged and Uc decayed to a minimum at a distance Lm. The merging of wakes and associated velocity minimum produced a local maximum in deposition downstream from and on the centerline between the patches. If this secondary region of enhanced deposition promotes new vegetation growth, the increased drag on the centerline could slow velocity between the upstream patch pair, leading to conditions favorable to their merger.},

For this revegetated with Halimione portulacoides and also in nearby sediments with savage H. portulacoides plants and bare sediments were monitored for comparison proposes. Sediments colonized by savage plants showed higher water content, organic matter, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous contents, in contrast with the low values observed in bare and colonized by transplants sediments. Overlooking the microbial metabolic and respiratory parameters it was observed that the more efficient microbial communities were present in the sediments colonized by the savage plants. Also the extracellular enzymes showed differences. In the transplant colonized sediments and also in the bare ones, peroxidase showed high and similar activities. By the contrary urease showed lower in these last sediments. Only acid phosphatase showed a different trend being higher in the bare sediments and in the sediments colonized by savage plants. Applying a rhizosphere sediment microbial index ({RSMI}) it was assessed that the more important factors for these sediments evaluation were the Basal respiration, urease activity, metabolic coefficient, total phosphorous content and total carbon content. Using this index for evaluation it showed not only that the sediments colonized by savage plants presented microbial quality, but also it was shown that the bare sediments and the sediments colonized by the transplants after a 1 year period still have the same microbial characteristics and thereby similar microbial qualities. This allowed to conclude that over the duration of this experiment, the revegetated sediments were still far from reaching the quality levels of the sediments naturally colonized, indicating that the 1 year period of revegetation was not enough to a successful restoration of a degraded salt marsh. Although the restoration process was not successful, the elaboration of the {RSMI} proved to be useful with applications in future monitorization programs.},

Longshore variability in wave intensity was found to affect kelp mortality rates. The data suggest that wave breaking may be an important factor in determining the inner boundary of the kelp bed.},

	abstract = {Computed tomography ({CT}) imaging has been used to describe and quantify subtidal, benthic animals such as polychaetes, amphipods, and shrimp. Here, for the first time, {CT} imaging is used to quantify wet mass of coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in cores collected from organic-rich (Jamaica Bay, New York) and mineral (North Inlet, South Carolina) Spartina alterniflora soils. Image analysis software was coupled with the {CT} images to measure abundance and diameter of the coarse roots and rhizomes in marsh soils. Previously, examination of marsh roots and rhizomes was limited to various hand-sieving methods that were often time-consuming, tedious, and error prone. {CT} imaging can discern the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat based on their varying particle densities. Calibration rods composed of materials with standard densities (i.e., air, water, colloidal silica, and glass) were used to operationally define the specific x-ray attenuations of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in the marsh cores. Significant regression relationships were found between the {CT}-determined wet mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes and the hand-sieved dry mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes in both the organic-rich and mineral marsh soils. There was also a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the {CT}-determined peat particle density among organic-rich and mineral soils. In only the mineral soils, there was a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the {CT}-determined peat wet mass. Using {CT} imaging, significant positive nitrogen fertilization effects on the wet masses of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat, and the abundance and diameter of rhizomes were measured in the mineral soils. In contrast, a deteriorating salt marsh island in Jamaica Bay had significantly less mass of coarse roots and rhizomes at depth (10–20 cm), and a significantly lower abundance of roots and rhizomes compared with a stable marsh. However, the diameters of the rhizomes in the deteriorating marsh were significantly greater than in the stable marsh. {CT} imaging is a rapid approach to quantify coarse roots, rhizomes, peat, and soil particle densities in coastal wetlands, but the method is unable at this time to quantify fine roots.},

	doi = {10.2175/193864705783968420},
	abstract = {The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (District) services Chicago and 124 suburban communities in Cook County, Illinois. The District collects and treats wastewater from a population equivalent to 11 million people and generates approximately 180,000 dry tons of biosolids annually. The District is committed to managing biosolids beneficially and economically. The District operates a diverse biosolids management program which consists of applying biosolids to strip mined land at its 15,006 acre site in Fulton County for the production of grain crops; applying biosolids to agricultural land in northeastern Illinois also for the production of grain crops; and using biosolids as a soil conditioner or soil substitute in the Chicago Metropolitan Area (Chicagoland).The use of biosolids in Chicagoland is attractive because it is the most economical management option, and it offers benefits to the District's local constituency. The local market includes the following uses of biosolids: Final protective layer of landfill covers Daily landfill cover Construction and renovation of recreational facilities (e.g. public parks, golf courses, athletic fields) Brownfield reclamation Commercial landscaping Roadside landscaping In order to be able to utilize biosolids in this market, the District had to address several regulatory requirements. The most important of these are the state and federal regulations for the land application of biosolids and biosolids use at Illinois landfills. In order for biosolids to be used with a minimum of regulatory and operational restrictions, the District made a commitment to only produce the highest quality biosolids for this market.The District undertook extraordinary measures to enforce its industrial waste control ordinances, and sought to obtain certification from the United States Environmental Protection Agency for its standard biosolids processing trains as equivalent to {PFRP}. As a result, the District produces {EQ} biosolids. The District also obtained Adjusted Standard 95–4 from the Illinois Pollution Control Board for the use of biosolids as a topsoil substitute in the final protective layer of landfills in Illinois. The District has established a partnership with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, and it operates the local land application program under a unique umbrella permit that covers all projects and minimizes regulatory hurdles for its customers.The District has undertaken several initiatives to increase public acceptance and demand for biosolids in Chicagoland. These initiatives have included constructing a large greenhouse for conducting research to support the local uses of biosolids and year-round demonstrations for public education and promotion. The District received the 2001 Research and Technology Award from the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies for the research and demonstrational activities it has done in the greenhouse. The District has established several visible field research and demonstration projects in Chicagoland. The most notable is a large demonstration of the use of biosolids for reclaiming brownfield sites having steel mill slag based soils (the southeast side of Chicago contains several thousand acres of these brownfields). The study was undertaken in partnership with the Chicago Park District. It has been conducted since 2000, and it includes a significant research component. The project and the two field days that have been held at the site have promoted interest in the District's biosolids. The District has also produced a promotional brochure, which it distributes to prospective new users at first time meetings, or at displays presented at local conferences, meetings, or other public events. The District has also expanded the staff of the Biosolids Utilization and Soil Science Section of its R\&D Department to provide technical support to local biosolids users and to follow the conduct of each local project. The District has been producing short case studies of selected local use projects, and it recently published its first booklet of case studies for promotional use. The booklet has been very popular, and it has been successful in generating increased interest in the biosolids.},

Because the flow and the vegetation canopy move in phase and thus minimise their interactions, the drag dissipation is decreased. The correlation between the two components of the perturbation flow velocity in the mixing layer is increased and makes the perturbation flow more efficient at extracting energy from the mean flow.},

	abstract = {Reintroduction of fresh water to coastal systems with altered hydrologic regimes is a management option for restoring degraded wetland habitats. Plant production in these systems is believed to be enhanced by increased nutrient availability and reduced salinity. Although studies have documented nutrient limitation and salinity stress in coastal marshes, interpreting the effects of freshwater reintroduction on plant production is difficult because high nutrient availability often is confounded with low salinity. We tested the hypothesis that plant growth response to nutrients does not vary with salinity in a greenhouse study. Treatments consisted of four nutrient concentrations and four non-lethal salinity levels; plant response was measured as biomass accumulation after 144 days of exposure. The significant interaction between salinity and nutrient concentrations indicates that response of Spartina patens marshes to freshwater inflows would vary by site-specific soil conditions. Biomass decreased with increased salinity at all four nutrient concentrations with variation among the nutrient concentrations decreasing as salinity increased. We demonstrate the importance of considering ambient salinity and nutrient soil conditions in restoration planning involving freshwater inflow. We propose salinity should remain a primary concern in restoration plans targeted at improving degraded S. patens-dominated marsh habitat.},

	abstract = {To counteract extensive wetland loss a series of diversion projects have been implemented to introduce freshwater and sediment from the Mississippi River into Louisiana coastal wetlands. To keep pace with increases in water level due to subsidence Louisiana coastal marshes must vertically accrete through the accumulation of both organic matter and mineral sediment. The impact of Mississippi River freshwater diversion on enhancing vertical marsh accretion (mineral and organic matter accumulation) was examined in Breton Sound estuary, a coastal wetland experiencing marsh deterioration as result of subsidence and salt water intrusion. Using 137Cs dating and artificial marker horizons, increases in the rate of vertical marsh accretion were measured at marsh sites along a spatial gradient which has been receiving diverted water from the Mississippi River (Caernarvon diversion) since 1991. Vertical accretion and accumulation of mineral sediment organic matter and nutrients in the marsh soil profile, increased at marsh sites receiving freshwater and sediment input. Iron and manganese content of the marsh surface sediment were shown to be an excellent signature of riverine sediment deposition. Soil extractable phosphorus was higher and extractable sodium was lower at sites nearest freshwater and sediment input. Results demonstrated that freshwater diversion through sediment input and lowering of salinity will enhance marsh accretion and stability, slowing or reversing the rate of wetland loss.},

	url = {http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/7773/},
	abstract = {Vegetation is a common feature within natural river channels and exerts a profound influence on the functioning of the fluvial system. In particular, the interaction between vegetation and flow causes a reduction in conveyance, an alteration to the velocity profile and the generation of coherent turbulent structures which differ to those found in un-vegetated channels. Recognition of the influence of vegetation on open channel flow has led to an increased awareness of the importance of accurately representing the effects of vegetation within numerical models, across a range of spatial scales.

This thesis introduces two novel biomechanical models, capable of simulating the complex interaction between flow and vegetation at high spatial and temporal resolution. The development and validation of these models permits investigation of flow-vegetation interactions across a range of plant types and flow conditions. These models are applied to a range of scenarios providing new insight into the interaction mechanisms between the vegetation and the flow. In particular, this thesis focuses on the role of turbulent structures in driving flow-vegetation interaction. 

The results presented in this thesis support existing theories for simple canopy flows, whilst also proposing additional interactions in the case of more complex canopies. In addition, key findings relating to the role of drag in controlling flow-vegetation interactions are explored.

Finally, through the development of a third, lower resolution, vegetation model, this thesis begins to explore how the process understanding gained from application of the high resolution models may be upscaled to the reach scale models which are central to river management.},

The root system morphology of vetiver was investigated in a small plantation growing on abandoned marl terraces in southern Spain. Root distribution with depth, laterally from the plant, as well as root parameters such as root diameter and tensile strength were also investigated. The profile wall method combined with the block excavation showed that the vetiver grass grows numerous positively gravitropic roots of more or less uniform diameter. These were generally distributed in the uppermost soil horizon closer to the culm base. In situ shear test on blocks of soil permeated with vetiver roots were carried out and showed a greater shear strength resistance than the samples of non vegetated soil. The root reinforcement measured in situ was comparable to the one predicted by the perpendicular root reinforcement model. The stability of a modelled terraced slope planted with vetiver was marginally greater than the one of a non-vegetated slope. A local instability on one terrace can have a detrimental effect on the overall stability of the terraced slope.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the tidal effects on aeration conditions for plant root respiration in a tidal marsh. We extend the work of Ursino et al. (2004) by using a two-phase model for air and water flows in the marsh. Simulations have been conducted to examine directly the link between the airflow dynamics and the aeration condition in the marsh soil. The results show that the effects of entrapped air on water movement in the vadose zone are significant in certain circumstances. Single-phase models based on Richards' equation, which neglect such effects, may not be adequate for quantifying the aeration condition in tidal marsh. The optimal aeration condition, represented by the maximum of the integral magnitude of tidally advected air mass ({TAAM}) flux, is found to occur near the tidal creek for the four soil textures simulated. This may explain the observation that some salt marsh plant species grow better near tidal creeks than in the inner marsh areas. Our analyses, based on the two-phase model and predicted {TAAM} flux magnitude, provide further insight into the “positive feedback” mechanism proposed by Ursino et al. (2004). That is, pioneer plants may grow successfully near the creek where the root aeration condition is optimal. The roots of the pioneer plants can soften and loosen the rhizosphere soil, which increases the evapotranspiration rate, the soil porosity, and absolute permeability and weakens the capillary effects. These, in turn, improve further the root aeration conditions and may lead to colonization by plants less resistant to anaerobic conditions.},

	abstract = {On the shores of San Pablo Bay distinct zones are occupied by nearly monospecific communities of Spartina foliosa (in the mid-littoral zone) and Salicornia virginica (in the upper littoral zone). Measurements of above-ground and below-ground standing crop, and seasonal production were made in 1972 along two transects crossing the ecotone between the two species at Mean High Water Level: one on Mare Island and one on the Petaluma River. The above-ground standing crop and production of Spartina declined in all respects as the ecotone was approached on both transects. The above-ground standing crop and production of Salicornia also decreased toward the ecotone, but at Mare Island Salicornia was more productive per unit biomass or per stem in the Spartina zone than in the Salicornia zone. Living rhizomes and roots of Salicornia were found primarily in the upper 15 cm of soil. Living rhizomes and roots of Spartina were distributed throughout the soil profile but tended to be absent from the upper 15 cm in the Salicornia zone. Total standing crop and production, including both species, decreased to a minimum at the middle of the ecotone. It appears that the zonation is dependent on physical factors and physiological responses rather than on interspecific competitive effects.},

This new area, Hydrodynamics of Aquatic Ecosystems, bridges these disciplines together and is defined as a study of flow-organism interactions at multiple scales with particular focus on relevant transport processes and mutual physical impacts. Being an important part of its mother disciplines, Hydrodynamics of Aquatic Ecosystems deals with two key interconnected issues: (i) physical interactions between flow and organisms (e.g. due to an interplay between flow-induced forces and reaction forces generated by organisms) and (ii) ecologically relevant mass-transfer-uptake processes (e.g. due to molecular and turbulent diffusion). Key concepts and tools of Hydrodynamics of Aquatic Ecosystems are outlined first and then a promising approach that may provide a unifying platform for coupling and integrating ecological, hydrodynamic and biomechanical processes, known as the double-averaging methodology ({DAM}), is discussed.

	abstract = {In the Northeastern U.S., salt marsh area is in decline. Habitat change analysis has revealed fragmentation, displacement of high marsh by low marsh species, and marsh drowning, while development of adjacent uplands limits upslope migration. Measures of marsh vegetation loss for eight sites in Rhode Island and New York between ca.1970 and 2011 indicate that substantial loss has occurred over past decades, with higher loss rates found for lower elevation salt marshes. Using inundation experiments, field surveys, and {LiDAR} datasets, we developed an elevation-productivity relationship for Spartina alterniflora specific to the U.S. Northeast, and located current salt marsh orthometric heights on this curve. We estimate that 87 \% of Northeastern salt marshes are located at elevations where growth is limited by inundation. By manipulating water column nutrients, precipitation, and elevation, we further found that altered precipitation regime was associated with significant reductions in biomass, and that nutrient enrichment adversely impacts organic matter accumulation and peat formation. These results provide evidence that Northeastern U.S. marshes are vulnerable to the effects of accelerated sea level rise, and that neither precipitation changes, nor cultural eutrophication, will contribute positively to long-term salt marsh survival.},

Greater quantities of live above-ground biomass per m2 were collected at the man-made marsh than at natural marsh areas. The broad range of values for each of the vegetation parameters measured in each marsh, and the variation by elevation indicated that differences probably were not related to experimental establishment. Differences probably reflected environmental conditions at each area. Below-ground biomass was less in the artificial marsh than at natural marsh areas.

They have been described as the kidneys of the landscape for the biogeochemical and hydrologic roles that they provide (Mitsch and Gosselink, 1986). They prevent floods, cleanse waters, protect shorelines, and recharge groundwater aquifers. Just as important to some, wetlands provide haven for a wide variety of flora and fauna and offer a unique habitat for many rare and endangered species. But like the species that they harbor, wetlands themselves have been considered by some to be on the endangered list in the United States. While the extent of wetlands in presettlement United States is difficult to determine, our wetlands in the coterminous United States are estimated to have decreased, from approximately 60 to 75 million hectares to about 42 million hectares today ({OTA}, 1984; Mitsch and Gosselink, 1986). In midwestern states such as Ohio and Illinois, over 90\% of the wetlands were drained, partially in response to The Swamp Lands Acts of 1849, 1950, and 1860. The riparian and coastal wetlands of the midwestern United States, which once were connected to all the streams, rivers, and Great Lakes of the glaciated Midwest are, for all intents and purposes, gone from the landscape. With their loss, our rivers and streams have lost their ability to cleanse themselves and the Great Lakes are no longer buffered from upland regions.},

The boundary-layer formulation allows for explicit calculation of the mud-induced wave damping rate. The model performed well in tests based on laboratory data. Numerical tests show that damping of high frequency waves occurs, mediated by “difference” nonlinear interactions. Simulations of 2-dimensional wave propagation over a mud “patch” of finite extent show that the wave dissipation causes significant downwave diffraction effects.},

	abstract = {Vertical accretion in tidal marshes is necessary to prevent submergence due to rising sea levels. Mineral materials may be more important in driving vertical accretion in tidal freshwater marshes, which are found near the heads of estuaries, than has been reported for salt marshes. Accretion rates for tidal freshwater marshes in North America and Europe (n = 76 data points) were compiled from the literature. Simple and multiple linear regression analyses revealed that both organic and mineral accumulations played a role in driving tidal freshwater marsh vertical accretion rates, although a unit mass of organic material contributed ∼4 times more to marsh volume than the same mass input of mineral material. Despite the higher mineral content of tidal freshwater marsh soils, this ability of organic matter to effectively hold water and air in interstitial spaces suggests that organic matter is responsible for 62\% of marsh accretion, with the remaining 38\% from mineral contributions. The organic material that helps to build marsh elevation is likely a combination of in situ production and organic materials that are deposited in association with mineral sediment particles. Regional differences between tidal freshwater marshes in the importance of organic vs. mineral contributions may reflect differences in sediment availability, climate, tidal range, rates of sea level rise, and local-scale factors such as site elevation and distance to tidal creeks. Differences in the importance of organic and mineral accumulations between tidal freshwater and salt marshes are likely due to a combination of factors, including sediment availability (e.g., proximity to upland sources and estuarine turbidity maxima) and the lability of freshwater vs. salt marsh plant production.},

	abstract = {In Louisiana, salt marshes are being created in an effort to offset the large loss of such habitat that has occurred over the last 50 yr. Primary productivity is an important function and indicator of success for salt marsh creation and restoration projects. The aim of this study was to determine whether the aboveground and belowground productivity of the dominant salt marsh {grassSpartina} alterniflora in created marshes in southwest Louisiana began to approximate productivity levels in natural marshes, over time. Net annual aboveground primary productivity ({NAPP}) was measured by a harvest technique, while the ingrowth core method was used to estimate net annual belowground primary productivity ({NBPP}). {NAPP} levels were similar to those found in other, Louisiana salt marshes, while {NBPP} levels were similar to or higher than the reported range {forS}. alterniflora studied along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. {NAPP} tended to decrease as the created marshes aged, but the levels in the oldest, 19 year old, created marsh were still well above values measured in the, natural marshes. It was estimated that it would take 35 yr after marsh creation for {NAPP} in the created marshes to become equivalent to that in natural marshes. {NBPP} in the created marshes became equivalent to levels found in the natural marshes after 6–8 yr, but then belowground production increased with marsh age, reaching an asymptote that surpassed natural marsh levels. Equivalency in primary productivity has not been reached in these marshes. Elevation also affected productivity, as higher elevational sites with greater topographic heterogeneity had significantly lower aboveground and belowground biomass levels than those with elevations closer to mean sea level. This underscores the need to construct marshes so that their mean elevation and degree of topographic heterogeneity are similar to natural marshes.},

Subject to localized subsidence and urban development, these marshes may also be affected by increased nutrient loading in the future from proposed Mississippi River diversions and continued urbanization. This study presents data on marsh surface elevation change across a series of experimental plots located in Big Branch Marsh National Wildlife Refuge, Louisiana, that were subject to varying additions of phosphorus and nitrogen as well as a lethal herbicide treatment. These plots were also affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. The rate of marsh elevation change prior to the storm suggests these marshes were maintaining elevation in the face of sea-level rise. A dramatic increase in elevation occurred following the storms but was followed by a proportional decrease in elevation. Soil data indicate the increase was caused by an influx of highly organic material at all plots. The results show how both storm and nonstorm processes contribute to elevation change and the maintenance of these marshes in the face of sea-level rise.},

	abstract = {Over the last decades, population densities in coastal areas have strongly increased. At the same time, many intertidal coastal ecosystems that provide valuable services in terms of coastal protection have greatly degraded. As a result, coastal defense has become increasingly dependent on man-made engineering solutions. Ongoing climate change processes such as sea-level rise and increased storminess, require a rethinking of current coastal defense practices including the development of innovative and cost-effective ways to protect coastlines. Integrating intertidal coastal ecosystems within coastal defense schemes offers a promising way forward. In this perspective, we specifically aim to (1) provide insight in the conditions under which ecosystems may be valuable for coastal protection, (2) discuss which might be the most promising intertidal ecosystems for this task and (3) identify knowledge gaps that currently hamper application and hence need attention from the scientific community. Ecosystems can contribute most to coastal protection by wave attenuation in areas with relatively small tidal amplitudes, and/or where intertidal areas are wide. The main knowledge gap hampering application of intertidal ecosystems within coastal defense schemes is lack in ability to account quantitatively for long-term ecosystem dynamics. Such knowledge is essential, as this will determine both the predictability and reliability of their coastal defense function. Solutions integrating intertidal ecosystems in coastal defense schemes offer promising opportunities in some situations, but require better mechanistic understanding of ecosystem dynamics in space and time to enable successful large-scale application.},

	abstract = {The use of wetlands for treatment of wastewaters has a number of important ecological and economic benefits. Adding nutrient rich treated wastewater effluent to selected coastal wetlands results in the following benefits: (1) improved effluent water quality; (2) increased accretion rates to help offset subsidence; (3) increased productivity of vegetation; and (4) financial and energy savings of capital not invested in conventional tertiary treatment systems. We present as case studies results from several wetlands that are receiving secondarily treated wastewater in coastal Louisiana. At one site where sedimentation accumulation was measured, rates of accretion increased significantly after wastewater application began in the treatment site (from 7.8 to 11.4 mm yr−1) and approached the estimated rate of regional relative sea level rise ({RSLR}) (12.0 mm yr−1). No corresponding increase was observed in an adjacent control site. This suggests that the application of nutrient-rich wastewater can help coastal wetlands survive sea level rise. In the same site, surface water nutrient reduction, from the effluent inflow to outflow (1600 m), ranged from 100\% for nitrate-nitrogen ({NO}3-N) to 66\% for total phosphorus (P). At a second site, a forested wetland that has been receiving wastewater effluent for 50 years, N and P were both reduced by more than 90\%. Nutrient reduction is due to three main pathways: burial, denitrification and plant uptake. Dendrochronological analysis at the second site revealed that stem growth increased significantly in the treatment site after wastewater applications began, and was significantly greater than an adjacent control site. Similar increases in productivity have been measured in a number of wetland treatment sites. Economic analyses comparing conventional and wetland systems indicate savings range from \$500,000 to \$2.6 million. In addition there are substantial energy savings.},

We tested three treatments (adding tidal creeks, planting seedlings in tight clusters, and rototilling kelp compost into the soil) in a site that was excavated to reinstate tidal flows and restore salt marsh. The magnitude of responses was the reverse of expectations, with tidal creeks having the least effect and kelp compost the most. On the marsh plain, kelp compost significantly increased soil organic matter (by 17\% at 0–5 cm; p = 0.026 and 11.5\% at 5–20 cm; p = 0.083), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (45\% at 5–8 cm; p {\textless} 0.001) and inorganic nitrogen (35\% at 5–8 cm; p {\textless} 0.006), and decreased bulk density (16\% at 0–5 cm; p {\textless} 0.001 and 21\% at 5–8 cm depth; p {\textless} 0.001) compared to control plots. Survivorship of kelp compost treated plantings increased, along with growth ({\textgreater} 50\% increase in a growth index at 20 months after planting; p {\textless} 0.0001). In Spartina foliosa plots, kelp compost did not affect soil organic matter, but plants were taller (by {\textasciitilde}11 cm; p = 0.003) and denser (47\% more stems; p = 0.003). Planting seedlings 10-cm apart in tight clusters on the marsh plain increased survivorship by 18\% (compared to 90-cm apart in loose clusters; p = 0.053), but not growth. Tidal creek networks increased survivorship of Batis maritima and Jaumea carnosa by ≥20\% (p = 0.060 and 0.077, respectively). Kelp compost had a strong, positive influence on vegetation establishment by ameliorating some of the abiotic stress.},

Moreover, the use of saline water affects physical parameters such as aggregate stability, and thus, bulk density. Organic amendments have been proposed as an effective method to improve physical properties of soils. In this paper, the effect of successive biosolids (sewage sludge) amendments on aggregate stability percentage and bulk density on two degraded soils (one salinized) have been evaluated during several samplings. Different relationships between these parameters (aggregate stability and bulk density) with organic carbon, carbohydrates and exchangeable sodium percentage have been observed in these soils. The application of biosolids increased significantly the organic carbon, carbohydrates and aggregate stability percentage, resulting in a decrease of the bulk density of both soils. In the non-salinized soil, the increase in aggregate stability was related to the increase in organic carbon and carbohydrates. But in the salinized soil, the increase in aggregate stability was related to the increase in carbohydrates and specially to the decrease in exchangeable sodium percentage. In both soils, the decreases in bulk density by the organic amendments were related to the increase in aggregate stability. Application of biosolids could be a successful practice to improve soil structure in degraded soils.},

	abstract = {A critical component of flood protection in some coastal areas is expected to be the potential contribution of wetlands to the lowering of surges as they propagate inland from the coast. Consequently, an accurate method to quantify the effect of wetlands on coastal surge levels is required. The degree to which wetlands attenuate surge is the subject of debate and difficult to assess. The potential of wetlands to reduce storm surge has typically been expressed as a constant attenuation rate, but the relationship is much more complex. A numerical storm surge model was applied to assess the sensitivity of surge response to specified wetland loss. Results suggest that wetlands do have the potential to reduce surges but the magnitude of attenuation is dependent on the surrounding coastal landscape and the strength and duration of the storm forcing. Numerical models that simulate the relevant physical processes can provide valuable information on how to best integrate wetlands into coastal protection plans. However, while the model applied for this study has displayed skill in estimating surges over wetlands, the formulations are missing key processes and model advancements are necessary.},

	abstract = {The use of dredge material is a well-known technique for creating or restoring salt marshes that is expected to become more common along the Gulf of Mexico coast in the future. However, the effectiveness of this restoration method is still questioned. Wetland structural characteristics were compared between four created and three natural salt marshes in southwest Louisiana, {USA}. The created marshes, formed by the pumping of dredge material into formerly open water areas, represent a chronosequence, ranging in age from 3 to 19 years. Vegetation and soil structural factors were compared to determine whether the created marshes become more similar over time to the natural salt marshes. Vegetation surveys were conducted in 1997, 2000, and 2002 using the line-intercept technique. Site elevations were measured in 2000. Organic matter ({OM}) was measured in 1996 and 2002, while bulk density and soil particle-size distribution were determined in 2002 only. The natural marshes were dominated by Spartina alterniflora, as were the oldest created marshes; these marshes had the lowest mean site elevations ({\textless}30 cm {NGVD}). The six-year-old created marsh (formed in 1996) was higher in elevation ({\textgreater} 35 cm {NGVD}) and became dominated by high marsh (S. patens, Distichlis spicata) and shrub (Baccharis halimifolia, Iva frutescens) species. The higher elevation marsh seems to be following a different plant successional trajectory than the other marshes, indicating a relationship between marsh elevation and species composition. The soils in both the created and natural marshes contain high levels of clays (30–65 \%), with sand comprising {\textless} 1 \% of the soil distribution. {OM} was significantly greater and bulk density significantly lower in two of the natural marshes when compared to the created marshes. The oldest created marsh had significantly greater {OM} than the younger created marshes, but it may still take several decades before equivalency is reached with the natural marshes. Vegetation structural characteristics in the created marshes take only a few years to become similar to those in the natural marshes, just so long as the marshes are formed at a proper elevation. This agrees with other studies from North Carolina and Texas. However, it will take several decades for the soil characteristics to reach equivalency with the natural marshes, if they ever will.},

	abstract = {Although the concept of ecosystem sustainability has a long-term focus, it is often viewed from a static system perspective. Because most ecosystems are dynamic, we explore sustainability assessments from three additional perspectives: resilient systems; systems where tipping points occur; and systems subject to episodic resetting. Whereas foundations of ecosystem resilience originated in ecology, recent discussions have focused on geophysical attributes, and it is recognized that dynamic system components may not return to their former state following perturbations. Tipping points emerge when chronic changes (typically anthropogenic, but sometimes natural) push ecosystems to thresholds that cause collapse of process and function and may become permanent. Ecosystem resetting occurs when episodic natural disasters breach thresholds with little or no warning, resulting in long-term changes to environmental attributes or ecosystem function. An example of sustainability assessment of ecosystem goods and services along the Gulf Coast ({USA}) demonstrates the need to include both the resilient and dynamic nature of biogeomorphic components. Mountain road development in northwest Yunnan, China, makes rivers and related habitat vulnerable to tipping points. Ecosystems reset by natural disasters are also presented, emphasizing the need to understand the magnitude frequency and interrelationships among major disturbances, as shown by (i) the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and resulting tsunami, including how unsustainable urban development exacerbates geodisaster propagation, and (ii) repeated major earthquakes and associated geomorphic and vegetation disturbances in Papua New Guinea. Although all of these ecosystem perturbations and shifts are individually recognized, they are not embraced in contemporary sustainable decision making.},

	abstract = {The primary goal of most habitat restoration projects is to improve ecosystem functions as compensation for habitat loss or degradation, but the optimal engineering approach to achieve that outcome is not always known a priori. Restored coastal wetlands are frequently engineered to create mound and terrace formations at low marsh elevations, but there have been few opportunities to quantitatively compare the ecological characteristics of construction methods that differ in soil source and configuration. Our study took place in a restored (2008) brackish marsh (Texas, {USA}) that included mounded formations built from on-site soil, off-site dredge material, or a combination of soil sources. We used a two-year (2009–2010) dataset from a restoration monitoring program that included emergent plant, water, soil, aquatic plant, and aquatic faunal characteristics to address two questions: (1) Do construction methods combining different soil sources and dredging techniques confer unique ecological characteristics? (2) Is there an ecological benefit to incorporating heterogeneity in a restored site by employing multiple construction methods? Our analyses revealed that plant root biomass and soil nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were two times higher in the reference area than in any of the restored areas. Among the restoration construction methods, ecosystem characteristics were similar to each other within two years of restoration. In general, ecosystem characteristics were affected more by temporal variation between years than by construction method. Differences between years were driven by water characteristics; unusually high tides in 2010 doubled salinity and decreased water chlorophyll a concentration and dissolved inorganic nitrogen by half. Although the restored areas did not achieve all reference characteristics during the early development of the site, the differences among engineering approaches were relatively subtle. Therefore, the recommendation for practice is to use the approach that is most cost-effective for a specific site. In our study area, the dredging methods yielded the largest area of emergent marsh per unit effort, but the on-site soil excavations created more aquatic habitat. When ecological integrity is defined as the provision of a wide range of biotic and abiotic conditions at a landscape scale, then the use of different engineering approaches at different sites within a region creates habitat heterogeneity, thus conferring regional-level ecological benefits.},

Three unstructured coastal circulation models ({ADCIRC}, {FVCOM}, and {SELFE}) validated with similar skill on a new common Gulf scale mesh ({ULLR}) with identical frictional parameterization and forcing for the tidal validation and hurricane hindcasts. Coupled circulation and wave models, {SWAN}+{ADCIRC} and {WWMII}+{SELFE}, along with {FVCOM} loosely coupled with {SWAN}, also validated with similar skill. {NOAA}'s official operational forecast storm surge model ({SLOSH}) was implemented on local and Gulf scale meshes with the same wind stress and pressure forcing used by the unstructured models for hindcasts of Ike and Rita. {SLOSH}'s local meshes failed to capture regional processes such as Ike's forerunner and the results from the Gulf scale mesh further suggest shortcomings may be due to a combination of poor mesh resolution, missing internal physics such as tides and nonlinear advection, and {SLOSH}'s internal frictional parameterization. In addition, these models were benchmarked to assess and compare execution speed and scalability for a prototypical operational simulation. It was apparent that a higher number of computational cores are needed for the unstructured models to meet similar operational implementation requirements to {SLOSH}, and that some of them could benefit from improved parallelization and faster execution speed.},

	abstract = {Since 1972 over 940 ha (2,300 ac) of leveed former salt marsh sites around San Francisco Bay have been restored to tidal action, purposely or through natural processes. The evolution of these sites can inform predictions of rates of marshplain evolution and establishment of tidal channel systems. A review of the history of 15 re-flooded sites ranging in size from 18 to 220 ha (45 to 550 ac) and in age from 2 to 29 years indicates that marshplain vegetation with more than 50\% cover was established at nine of the sites within 4 to 20 years. The remaining six sites aged 2 to approximately 20 years continue to be less than 50\% vegetated. The evolution of these sites is consistent with the following simple conceptual model of the physical evolution of restored tidal marshes in subsided breached sites. Initially, deposition of estuarine sediment builds up mudflats that allow vegetation establishment once elevations are high enough for vegetation to survive. Sites that are initially lower in the tidal frame take longer to vegetate than those that are initially higher. Three factors appear to retard the time frame for vegetation establishment: limited estuarine suspended sediment supply, erosion of deposited estuarine muds by internally generated wind waves, and restricted tidal exchange. These factors affect evolution more significantly in larger sites. The comparatively short time frame for vegetation colonization and marshplain evolution experienced in earlier, smaller, and/or less subsided breached levee restorations may not necessarily be replicable by simple levee breaching on larger subsided restoration sites now being planned. Our review of the 15 sites also indicates that the formation of tidal channels within the marshes is greatly dependent on whether and how high the site was filled before breaching. Filled sites at high intertidal elevations (above approximately 0.3 m below mean higher high water) can vegetate quickly but after several decades may show little development of tidal channels.},

In vegetated canopy open-channel flow, velocity profiles are changed largely in the vertical direction resulting in the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Consequently, large-scale organized vortices are induced, which dominate the momentum transfer and scalar concentration among canopies. The downstream advection of coherent vortices causes the coherent waving of aquatic vegetation, referred to as Monami. However, the flow-visualization techniques such as {PIV} have not been sufficiently applied to these complicated flows in previous studies, such that no detailed information on the interaction between the flow field and the plant motion exists. Simultaneous measurements of turbulence and vegetation motion were conducted herein for open-channel flows with flexible vegetation by using a combination of {PIV} and {PTV} techniques. The former part of this study focuses on the effects of Monami phenomena on mean-flow and turbulence structures. The latter part examines an interaction between the coherent structure and the vegetation motion.},

Scientists worldwide are looking at the ecological and hydrological impacts resulting from climate change. Climate change will make future efforts to restore and manage wetlands more complex. Wetland systems are vulnerable to changes in quantity and quality of their water supply, and it is expected that climate change will have a pronounced effect on wetlands through alterations in hydrological regimes with great global variability. Wetland habitat responses to climate change and the implications for restoration will be realized differently on a regional and mega-watershed level, making it important to recognize that specific restoration and management plans will require examination by habitat. Floodplains, mangroves, seagrasses, saltmarshes, arctic wetlands, peatlands, freshwater marshes and forests are very diverse habitats, with different stressors and hence different management and restoration techniques are needed. The Sundarban (Bangladesh and India), Mekong river delta (Vietnam), and southern Ontario (Canada) are examples of major wetland complexes where the effects of climate change are evolving in different ways. Thus, successful long term restoration and management of these systems will hinge on how we choose to respond to the effects of climate change. How will we choose priorities for restoration and research? Will enough water be available to rehabilitate currently damaged, water-starved wetland ecosystems? This is a policy paper originally produced at the request of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and incorporates opinion, interpretation and scientific-based arguments.},

The {GOM} region continues to experience substantial losses of coastal wetlands, but the magnitude of reduction in ecosystem services resulting from the loss of {GOM} coastal wetlands is unknown. To gain an appreciation of the impact of {GOM} coastal wetland loss on ecosystem services, recent literature was reviewed to derive quantitative estimates of ecosystem services provided by {GOM} coastal wetlands. {GOM} coastal wetlands provide essential habitat for the production of juvenile shrimp, which supports the {GOM}’s most valuable commercial fishery; protect coastal communities from storm surge; improve water quality by removing nitrogen from surface waters; and are valuable sinks for greenhouse gases due to high rates of carbon sequestration combined with low rates of methane emission. Using 1998 to 2004 as a baseline, the potential loss of ecosystem services associated with loss of coastal wetlands is presented. Additional research is needed to quantify wetland services at multiple geospatial and socioeconomic scales, to determine the effect of wetland loss on ecosystem services, and to demonstrate the impact of future management decisions on the capacity of {GOM} coastal wetlands to provide services that affect human well-being.},

	abstract = {Vegetation controls soil erosion rates significantly. The decrease of water erosion rates with increasing vegetation cover is exponential. This review reveals that the decrease in water erosion rates with increasing root mass is also exponential, according to the equation {SEP} e b {RP} where {SEP} is a soil erosion parameter (e.g., interrill or rill erosion rates relative to erosion rates of bare topsoils without roots), {RP} is a root parameter (e.g., root density or root length density) and b is a constant that indicates the effectiveness of the plant roots in reducing soil erosion rates. Whatever rooting parameter is used, for splash erosion b equals zero. For interrill erosion the average b-value is 0.1195 when root density (kg m 3) is used as root parameter, and 0.0022 when root length density (km m 3) is used. For rill erosion these average b-values are 0.5930 and 0.0460, respectively. The similarity of this equation for root effects with the equation for vegetation cover effects is striking, but it is yet impossible to determine which plant element has the highest impact in reducing soil losses, due to incomparable units. Moreover, all the studies on vegetation cover effects attribute soil loss reduction to the above-ground biomass only, whereas in reality this reduction results from the combined effects of roots and canopy cover. Based on an analysis of available data it can be concluded that for splash and interrill erosion vegetation cover is the most important vegetation parameter, whereas for rill and ephemeral gully erosion plant roots are at least as important as vegetation cover.},

	abstract = {We examined the effects of seasonal salinity changes on sediment ammonium ({NH}4 +) adsorption and exchange across the sediment–water interface in the Parker River Estuary, by means of seasonal field sampling, laboratory adsorption experiments, and modeling. The fraction of dissolved {NH}4 + relative to adsorbed {NH}4 + in oligohaline sediments rose significantly with increased pore water salinity over the season. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that small (∼3) increases in salinity from freshwater conditions had the greatest effect on {NH}4 + adsorption by reducing the exchangeable pool from 69\% to 14\% of the total {NH}4 + in the upper estuary sediments that experience large (0–20) seasonal salinity shifts. {NH}4 + dynamics did not appear to be significantly affected by salinity in sediments of the lower estuary where salinities under 10 were not measured. We further assessed the importance of salinity-mediated desorption by constructing a simple mechanistic numerical model for pore water chloride and {NH}4 + diffusion for sediments of the upper estuary. The model predicted pore water salinity and {NH}4 + profiles that fit measured profiles very well and described a seasonal pattern of {NH}4 + flux from the sediment that was significantly affected by salinity. The model demonstrated that changes in salinity on several timescales (tidally, seasonally, and annually) can significantly alter the magnitude and timing of {NH}4 + release from the sediments. Salinity-mediated desorption and fluxes of {NH}4 + from sediments in the upper estuary can be of similar magnitude to rates of organic nitrogen mineralization and may therefore be important in supporting estuarine productivity when watershed inputs of N are low.},

	abstract = {Patterns of mangrove vegetation in two distinct basins of Florida Coastal Everglades ({FCE}), Shark River estuary and Taylor River Slough, represent unique opportunities to test hypotheses that root dynamics respond to gradients of resources, regulators, and hydroperiod. We propose that soil total phosphorus (P) gradients in these two coastal basins of {FCE} cause specific patterns in belowground biomass allocation and net primary productivity that facilitate nutrient acquisition, but also minimize stress from regulators and hydroperiod in flooded soil conditions. Shark River basin has higher P and tidal hydrology with riverine mangroves, in contrast to scrub mangroves of Taylor basin with more permanent flooding and lower P across the coastal landscape. Belowground biomass (0–90 cm) of mangrove sites in Shark River and Taylor River basins ranged from 2317 to 4673 g m−2, with the highest contribution (62–85\%) of roots in the shallow root zone (0–45 cm) compared to the deeper root zone (45–90 cm). Total root productivity did not vary significantly among sites and ranged from 407 to 643 g m−2 y−1. Root production in the shallow root zone accounted for 57–78\% of total production. Root turnover rates ranged from 0.04 to 0.60 y−1 and consistently decreased as the root size class distribution increased from fine to coarse roots, indicating differences in root longevity. Fine root biomass was negatively correlated with soil P density and frequency of inundation, whereas fine root turnover decreased with increasing soil N:P ratios. Lower P availability in Taylor River basin relative to Shark River basin, along with higher regulator and hydroperiod stress, confirms our hypothesis that interactions of stress from resource limitation and long duration of hydroperiod account for higher fine root biomass along with lower fine root production and turnover. Because fine root production and organic matter accumulation are the primary processes controlling soil formation and accretion in scrub mangrove forests, root dynamics in the P-limited carbonate ecosystem of south Florida have a major controlling role as to how mangroves respond to future impacts of sea-level rise.},

The mechanistic studies revealed the substrate-inhibitor interaction to be the overall major mechanism of inhibition. This interaction was shown to involve substrate depletion, probably involving some primary sites of the natural substrate casein. Some inhibition was also shown to be due to an interaction between the enzyme and the inhibitior molecules. The interactions of the inhibitor with the enzyme and the substrate were irreversible.

Although the microstructure of plant cell walls varies in different types of plants, broadly speaking, cellulose fibres reinforce a matrix of hemicellulose and either pectin or lignin. The cellular structure of plants varies too, from the largely honeycomb-like cells of wood to the closed-cell, liquid-filled foam-like parenchyma cells of apples and potatoes and to composites of these two cellular structures, as in arborescent palm stems. The arrangement of the four basic building blocks in plant cell walls and the variations in cellular structure give rise to a remarkably wide range of mechanical properties: Young's modulus varies from 0.3 {MPa} in parenchyma to 30 {GPa} in the densest palm, while the compressive strength varies from 0.3 {MPa} in parenchyma to over 300 {MPa} in dense palm. The moduli and compressive strength of plant materials span this entire range. This study reviews the composition and microstructure of the cell wall as well as the cellular structure in three plant materials (wood, parenchyma and arborescent palm stems) to explain the wide range in mechanical properties in plants as well as their remarkable mechanical efficiency.},

Trees in the treatment, downstream outflow, and adjacent untreated control areas all experienced increased growth coinciding with a period of widespread rapid subsidence and water-level increases in the late 1960s. Tree growth in the treatment and outflow sites began to decrease before wastewater application began in 1992, and afterward was apparently unaffected by treatment. In contrast, trees in the control site have not experienced growth declines. Hydrological changes caused by subsidence have apparently overwhelmed any effect of wastewater treatment on baldcypress growth. Increasing inundation may have increased growth initially by eliminating competition from species less tolerant of inundation; however, after a decade of sustained higher water, growth declined steadily. Release of baldcypress from competition continues at the topographically higher control site, but growth will likely subsequently decrease as ongoing subsidence and eustatic sea-level rise cause more prolonged inundation. We conclude that short-term increases in water level stimulated growth of baldcypress, but long-term increased inundation was a net stressor and was more important than nutrient limitations in controlling growth at this site.},

	abstract = {Abstract
Key differences exist between tidal fresh- and saltwater marshes, such as the relative importance of mineral versus organic sedimentation and plant species diversity, that likely result in different drivers of sedimentation. In tidal freshwater marshes, we hypothesize that vegetation composition, along with physical marsh features (i.e., elevation and tidal channels), play a critical role in sedimentation. This hypothesis is evaluated in Dyke Marsh Preserve (Potomac River, {VA}, {USA}) by examining sediment character (grain size, organic content) and deposition rates across the marsh in spring and summer 2010 and 2011. 7Be is especially well suited to capture seasonal sedimentation patterns owing to its short half-life (53.3 d) and ability to assess both sediment deposition and erosion. However, its use in marshes can be challenging, especially due the presence of vegetation. In this study, 7Be-derived sedimentation rates are compared with sediment deposition observed on ceramic tiles to assess its utility in tidal freshwater marshes, and biophysical influences on sediment deposition are examined through statistical models. 7Be- and tile-derived sedimentation rates show similar spatial and temporal patterns, with highest rates occurring at sites closer to tidal channels, highlighting the importance of sediment availability. In addition, complex feedbacks between sedimentation and the plant community are discussed.},

In this paper, we combine the updated Gridded Population of the World ({GPW}2) population distribution estimate for 1990 and lighted settlement imagery with a global digital elevation model ({DEM}) and a high resolution vector coastline. This produces bivariate distributions of population, lighted settlements and land area as functions of elevation and coastal proximity. The near-coastal population within 100 km of a shoreline and 100 m of sea level was estimated as \$1.2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}9\$ people with average densities nearly 3 times higher than the global average density. Within the near coastal-zone, the average population density diminishes more rapidly with elevation than with distance, while the opposite is true of lighted settlements. Lighted settlements are concentrated within 5 km of coastlines worldwide, whereas average population densities are higher at elevations below 20 m throughout the 100 km width of the near-coastal zone. Presently most of the near-coastal population live in relatively densely-populated rural areas and small to medium cities, rather than in large cities. A range of improvements are required to define a better baseline and scenarios for policy analysis. Improving the resolution of the underlying population data is a priority.},

(3) Most Rumex species have a tap-root from which the laterals originate. As a response to flooding, new laterals are formed. (4) The number, place of origin, growth direction and formation rate of new laterals differed between the species. (5) The number and formation rate of new roots were associated with the elevational distribution of the species: as a response to flooding, low-elevation species formed more new roots, and faster, than high-elevation species. (6) The high-elevation species had root porosity values lower than 10\%; the intermediate- and low-elevation species had values higher than 10\%. (7) Schizogenous aerenchyma was constitutively formed by the low-elevation and flood-tolerant R. maritimus, and not by the high-elevation and flood-intolerant species R. thyrsiflorus. In the intermediate-elevation species R. crispus it was induced in stagnant hypoxic solution cultures. (8) The results indicate that aerenchyma formation is closely connected with the growth rate of new roots. It appears that development of aerenchyma in the new roots is the main determinant in the flood-tolerance of Rumex species.},

In the aftermath of a series of recent natural disasters, including the Indian Ocean Tsunami, Hurricane Katrina and Cyclone Nargis, coastal vegetation has been widely promoted for the purpose of reducing the impact of large storm surges and tsunami. In this paper, we review the use of coastal vegetation as a “bioshield” against these extreme events. Our objective is to alter bioshield policy and reduce the long-term negative consequences for biodiversity and human capital. We begin with an overview of the scientific literature, in particular focusing on studies published since the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004 and discuss the science of wave attenuation by vegetation. We then explore case studies from the Indian subcontinent and evaluate the detrimental impacts bioshield plantations can have upon native ecosystems, drawing a distinction between coastal restoration and the introduction of exotic species in inappropriate locations. Finally, we place bioshield policies into a political context, and outline a new direction for coastal vegetation policy and research.},

Fertilization with nitrogen led to some significant changes in marsh processes, specifically increases in aboveground primary production and in {CO}2 fluxes from the soil. However, neither nitrogen nor phosphorus fertilization led to elevation loss (relative to controls), reduced soil carbon, or a decrease in belowground primary production, all of which have been proposed as links between elevated nutrient loads and marsh drowning. Our data suggest that high nutrient levels increase gross carbon loss from the sediment, but that this is compensated for by other processes, leading to no net deleterious effect of nutrient loading on carbon storage or on marsh stability with respect to sea level rise.},

	abstract = {An earlier investigation (Turner 1997) concluded that most of the coastal wetland loss in Louisiana was caused by the effects of canal dredging, that loss was near zero in the absence of canals, and that land loss had decreased to near zero by the late 1990s. This analysis was based on a 15-min quadrangle (approximately 68,000 ha) scale that is too large to isolate processes responsible for small-scale wetland loss and too small to capture those responsible for large-scale loss. We conducted a further evaluation of the relationship between direct loss due to canal dredging and all other loss from 1933–1990 using a spatial scale of 4,100 ha that accurately captures local land-loss processes. Regressions of other wetland loss on canal area (i.e., direct loss) for the Birdfoot, Terrebonne, and Calcasieu basins were not significant. Positive relationships were found for the Breton (r2=0.675), Barataria (r2=0.47), and Mermentau (r2=0.35) basins, indicating that the extent of canals is significantly related to wetland loss in these basins. A significant negative relationship (r2=0.36) was found for the Atchafalaya coastal basin which had statistically lower loss rates than the other basins as a whole. The Atchafalaya area receives direct inflow of about one third of the Mississippi discharge. When the data were combined for all basins, 9.2\% of the variation in other wetland loss was attributable to canals. All significant regressions intercepted the y-axis at positive loss values indicating that some loss occurred in the absence of canals. Wetland loss did not differ significantly from the coast inland or between marsh type. We agree with Turner that canals are an important agent in causing wetland loss in coastal Louisiana, but strongly disagree that they are responsible for the vast majority of this loss. We conclude that wetland loss in the Mississippi delta is an ongoing complex process involving several interacting factors and that efforts to create and restore Louisiana’s coastal wetlands must emphasize riverine inputs of freshwater and sediments.},

	abstract = {Marshes in the urban Jamaica Bay Estuary, New York, {USA} are disappearing at an average rate of 13 ha/yr, and multiple stressors (e.g., wastewater inputs, dredging activities, groundwater removal, and global warming) may be contributing to marsh losses. Among these stressors, wastewater nutrients are suspected to be an important contributing cause of marsh deterioration. We used census data, radiometric dating, stable nitrogen isotopes, and soil surveys to examine the temporal relationships between human population growth and soil nitrogen; and we evaluated soil structure with computer-aided tomography, surface elevation and sediment accretion trends, carbon dioxide emissions, and soil shear strength to examine differences among disappearing (Black Bank and Big Egg) and stable marshes ({JoCo}). Radiometric dating and nitrogen isotope analyses suggested a rapid increase in human wastewater nutrients beginning in the late 1840s, and a tapering off beginning in the 1930s when wastewater treatment plants ({WWTPs}) were first installed. Current {WWTPs} nutrient loads to Jamaica Bay are approximately 13 995 kg N/d and 2767 kg P/d. At Black Bank, the biomass and abundance of roots and rhizomes and percentage of organic matter on soil were significantly lower, rhizomes larger in diameter, carbon dioxide emission rates and peat particle density significantly greater, and soil strength significantly lower compared to the stable {JoCo} Marsh, suggesting Black Bank has elevated decomposition rates, more decomposed peat, and highly waterlogged peat. Despite these differences, the rates of accretion and surface elevation change were similar for both marshes, and the rates of elevation change approximated the long term relative rate of sea level rise estimated from tide gauge data at nearby Sandy Hook, New Jersey. We hypothesize that Black Bank marsh kept pace with sea level rise by the accretion of material on the marsh surface, and the maintenance of soil volume through production of larger diameter rhizomes and swelling (dilation) of waterlogged peat. {JoCo} Marsh kept pace with sea-level rise through surface accretion and soil organic matter accumulation. Understanding the effects of multiple stressors, including nutrient enrichment, on soil structure, organic matter accumulation, and elevation change will better inform management decisions aimed at maintaining and restoring coastal marshes.},

	abstract = {The losses or degradation of coastal lagoons, tidal wetlands and small estuaries during the past century have been dramatic, exceeding 95\% in some areas of the U.S. There is now widespread concern by regulatory agencies, local governments and public interest groups to preserve remaining tidal wetlands and enhance or restore degraded coastal wetland systems. Many of the characteristics of these ecosystems are governed by the tidal inlet channels which control the tidal exchange, hydroperiod, salinity and water quality, and local flooding. The stability of tidal inlets in many coastal lagoon/tidal wetland systems in California has been altered during the past century due to changes in the watershed, confinement of the inlet channel, and filling or diking of regions of the behind the inlet. The stability of tidal inlets is of ecological concern since periodic closure results in prolonged inundation of foraging habitat; alterations in the salinity characteristics of the wetlands; poorer water quality; and the formation of barriers to fish passage. Therefore, in many saltmarsh enhancement/restoration projects, the stability of the tidal inlet is an important factor. The management objectives of tidal inlets for ecological enhancement differ from the traditional objectives such as navigation, since heavily engineered solutions to stabilize the inlet, or extensive maintenance dredging are usually undesirable. If the level of engineering intervention is to be minimized, it is important to develop an understanding of the natural physical processes at a particular site. A range of semi-empirical criteria for assessing the stability of small-scale natural inlets are reviewed and the sensitivity of these criteria to uncertainties in field data or assumptions in the analyses are discussed.},

	abstract = {Fluid mud is a high concentration aqueous suspension of fine-grained sediment in which settling is substantially hindered. It constitutes a significant management problem in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and shelves by impeding navigation, reducing water quality and damaging equipment. Fluid mud accumulations have been observed in numerous locations worldwide, including Savannah Harbor, U.S., the Severn Estuary, U.K., and the Amazon River Delta, Brazil. This paper describes the present state of knowledge on fluid mud characteristics, processes, and modeling. Fluid mud consists of water, clay-sized particles, and organic material and displays a variety of rheological behaviors ranging from elastic to pseudo-plastic. It forms by three principle mechanisms: (1) the rate of sediment aggregation and settling into the near-bottom layer exceeds the dewatering rate of the suspension; (2) soft sediment beds fluidized by wave agitation; and (3) convergence of horizontally advected suspensions. Once formed, fluid mud is transported vertically by entrainment and horizontally by shear flows, gravity, and streaming. If not resuspended, it slowly consolidates to form bed material. Quantitative relationships have been formulated for key fluid mud formation and movement mechanisms, but they rely on empirical coefficients that are often site- or situation-specific and are not generally transferable. Research to define general relationships is needed.},

To determine how the root branching pattern may alter the anchorage efficiency of a tree, artificial model root systems with different topologies and branching angles were built. The root systems were embedded at various depths in wet sand and the pull-out resistance measured. A model to predict the uprooting resistance from the data collected was designed, allowing predictions of anchorage strength with regards to architecture. The dominant factors influencing pull-out resistance were the depth and length of roots in the soil. The most efficient type of branching pattern predicted by the program was one with an increased number of roots deep in the soil. The optimum branching angle most likely to resist pull-out is a vertical angle of 90° between a lateral and the main axis. The predicted mechanically optimal radial angle between a lateral branch and its daughter is between 0 and 20°. Values of branching angle are compared with those measured in real woody root systems of European larch and Sitka spruce.},

	abstract = {We present a combined theoretical and experimental investigation of two systems in which flexible bodies are induced to oscillate by steady flows. The first system we study consists of multiple thin sheets of paper in a steady flow, clamped at the downstream end, which we call the "clapping book". Pages sequentially lift off, accumulating in a stack of paper held up by the wind. When the elasticity and weight of the pages overcome the aerodynamic force, the book claps shut; this process then repeats. We investigate this system experimentally and theoretically, using the theory of beams in high Reynolds number flow, and test our predictions of the clapping period. The second system we consider is inspired by free-reed musical instruments, which produce sound by the oscillation of reeds, thin strips of metal tuned to specific pitches. Each reed is mounted above a slot on the upstream side of a support plate, a geometry that allows a steady flow to induce finite-amplitude oscillations. We study this system experimentally and propose models, also based on the theory of elastic beams in high Reynolds number flow. The relative merits of these models is assessed by comparing their predictions with experiments.},

	abstract = {We describe the responses of three halophytic grass species that dominate the low (Spartina anglica), middle (Puccinellia maritima) and high (Elymus pycnanthus) parts of a salt marsh, to soil conditions that are believed to favour contrasting root-growth strategies. Our hypotheses were: (1) individual lateral root length is enhanced by N limitations in the soil but restricted by oxygen limitations, (2) the density of root branching within a species is inversely related to the length of the lateral roots, and (3) species from high elevations (i.e. the driest parts of a marsh) are the most responsive to changing soil conditions. Plant growth responses and soil parameters showed that the contrasting but uniformly applied soil treatments were effective. All three species showed a small but significant shift towards a finer root diameter distribution when N was limiting, partly because of the finer diameters of the laterals (Elymus and Spartina) and partly because of increased length of individual 1st-order laterals (Elymus and Puccinellia). The increased length of the 1st-order laterals of Elymus and Puccinellia grown under low N indicates that the first part of hypothesis 1 may be true. However, lack of effect of flooding and reduced soil conditions lead us to reject the second part of hypothesis 1. Hypothesis 2 was rejected for these three halophytes, as the branch density of 1st- and 2nd-order laterals appears to be controlled by other factors than length of individual laterals. Hypothesis 3 may be true for specific root characteristics (e.g. length of individual 1st-order laterals), but cannot be generalised (e.g. branch density and topological index). In conclusion, the present data on root growth in contrasting but homogeneous soil conditions indicate that morphological responsiveness of the root systems of these halophytic grass species is limited, regardless of their location along the elevational gradient.},

	abstract = {Vegetation controls soil erosion rates significantly. The decrease of water erosion rates with increasing vegetation cover is exponential. This review reveals that the decrease in water erosion rates with increasing root mass is also exponential, according to the equation {SEP} e b {RP} where {SEP} is a soil erosion parameter (e.g., interrill or rill erosion rates relative to erosion rates of bare topsoils without roots), {RP} is a root parameter (e.g., root density or root length density) and b is a constant that indicates the effectiveness of the plant roots in reducing soil erosion rates. Whatever rooting parameter is used, for splash erosion b equals zero. For interrill erosion the average b-value is 0.1195 when root density (kg m 3) is used as root parameter, and 0.0022 when root length density (km m 3) is used. For rill erosion these average b-values are 0.5930 and 0.0460, respectively. The similarity of this equation for root effects with the equation for vegetation cover effects is striking, but it is yet impossible to determine which plant element has the highest impact in reducing soil losses, due to incomparable units. Moreover, all the studies on vegetation cover effects attribute soil loss reduction to the above-ground biomass only, whereas in reality this reduction results from the combined effects of roots and canopy cover. Based on an analysis of available data it can be concluded that for splash and interrill erosion vegetation cover is the most important vegetation parameter, whereas for rill and ephemeral gully erosion plant roots are at least as important as vegetation cover.},

The organic component is partly decomposed and humified material derived from human feces and bacterial biomass while the inorganic component is derived from materials such as soil, sediment, and inorganic residuals (e.g., silica). The major contaminants in biosolids are heavy metals (e.g., Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni, Cr, and As) plus a range of synthetic organic compounds. Following land application, biosolids-borne metals are typically immobile in soils. They can be toxic to soil microflora, small amounts may leach with soluble organic matter, they can be accumulated in plants and sometimes transferred to grazing animals (mainly by soil ingestion). Regulations and guidelines for biosolids applications are still principally based on total metal loadings and in the future the use of bioavailable metal concentrations in biosolids-treated soils should be considered. The significance, effects, and fate of biosolids-borne organic contaminants in soils are not well understood and require further study. In the majority of cases, neither heavy metal nor organic contaminants are considered a significant hazard to the soil–plant system. Indeed, land applications of biosolids can be highly beneficial to crop production since they supply substantial amounts of N, P, Ca, and Mg and added organic matter can improve soil physical properties and stimulate soil microbial activity. To avoid ground/surface water pollution, application rates should be based on the N need of the crop and potential N mineralization rate of biosolids-N, and the high P loadings need to be managed.},

A deep understanding of wetland system functioning cannot be acquired by simply reducing its dynamics to a collection of parts but requires the explicit description of wetland physical and ecological processes as fully interacting components. In fact, the complex spatial ecohydrological patterns characterizing wetland areas arise as a result of the coupled evolution of their ecological, hydrological, and morphological features. Here we examine observations of prominent spatial patterns in wetland vegetation and link them to the relevant hydrological and ecological processes. We describe the limitations to vegetation development due to scarce soil oxygen availability and implement a mathematical model, based on Richards' equation, coupling subsurface water flow and plant water uptake in a tidal salt marsh. The soil aeration patterns arising from such interactions highlight the central role of vegetation in increasing soil aeration, possibly inducing the establishment of a permanently aerated soil layer (in spite of tidal flooding), and the influence of different soil characteristics on soil oxygen availability. Finally, we discuss how ecohydrological interactions can contribute to explain patterns of vegetation colonization and spatial heterogeneity.},

For other values of α, including cases where the modulus of elasticity varies over the length of the stem, approximations leading to an upper and a lower estimate of the frequency of oscillation can be derived. For the limiting case of ω = 0, the differential equation is identical with Greenhill's equation for the stability against Euler buckling of a top-loaded slender pole. For stems without top loads, Mathematica 4.0 returns solutions only for two limiting cases, zero gravity (realized approximately for oscillations in a horizontal orientation of the stem) and for ω = 0 (Greenhill's equation). Approximations can be derived for all other cases. As an example, the oscillation of an Arundo donax plant stem is described.},

	abstract = {Mid Atlantic coastal salt marshes contain a matrix of vegetation diversified by tidal pools, pannes, and creeks, providing habitats of varying importance to many species of breeding, migrating, and wintering waterbirds. We hypothesized that changes in marsh elevation were not sufficient to keep pace with those of sea level in both vegetated and unvegetated Spartina alterniflora sites at a number of mid lagoon marsh areas along the Atlantic Coast. We also predicted that northern areas would suffer less of a deficit than would southern sites. Beginning in August 1998, we installed surface elevation tables at study sites on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, southern New Jersey, and two locations along Virginia's eastern shore. We compared these elevation changes over the 4-4.5 yr record with the long-term ({\textgreater} 50 yr) tidal records for each locale. We also collected data on waterbird use of these sites during all seasons of the year, based on ground surveys and replicated surveys from observation platforms. Three patterns of marsh elevation change were found. At Nauset Marsh, Cape Cod, the Spartina marsh surface tracked the pond surface, both keeping pace with regional sea-level rise rates. In New Jersey, the ponds are becoming deeper while marsh surface elevation remains unchanged from the initial reading. This may result in a submergence of the marsh in the future, assuming sea-level rise continues at current rates. Ponds at both Virginia sites are filling in, while marsh surface elevation rates do not seem to be keeping pace with local sea-level rise. An additional finding at all sites was that subsidence in the vegetated marsh surfaces was less than in unvegetated areas, reflecting the importance of the root mat in stabilizing sediments. The implications to migratory waterbirds are significant. Submergence of much of the lagoonal marsh area in Virginia and New Jersey over the next century could have major negative (i.e., flooding) effects on nesting populations of marsh-dependent seaside sparrows Ammodramus maritimus, saltmarsh sharp-tailed sparrows Ammodramus caudacutus, black rails Laterallus jamaicensis, clapper rails Rallus longirostris, Forster's terns Sterna forsteri, common terns Sterna hirundo, and gull-billed terns Sterna nilotica. Although short-term inundation of many lagoonal marshes may benefit some open-water feeding ducks, geese, and swans during winter, the long-term ecosystem effects may be detrimental, as wildlife resources will be lost or displaced. With the reduction in area of emergent marsh, estuarine secondary productivity and biotic diversity will also be reduced.},

This study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of these solids, collectively referred to as biosolids, as a source of {OWCs} to soil and water in contact with soil. Nine different biosolid products, produced by municipal wastewater treatment plants in seven different states, were analyzed for 87 different {OWCs}. Fifty-five of the {OWCs} were detected in at least one biosolid product. The 87 different {OWCs} represent a diverse cross section of emerging organic contaminants that enter wastewater treatment plants and may be discharged without being completely metabolized or degraded. A minimum of 30 and a maximum of 45 {OWCs} were detected in any one biosolid. The biosolids used in this study are produced by several production methods, and the plants they originate from have differing population demographics, yet the percent composition of total {OWC} content, and of the most common {OWCs}, typically did not vary greatly between the biosolids tested. The summed {OWC} content ranged from 64 to 1811 mg/kg dry weight. Six biosolids were collected twice, 3?18 months apart, and the total {OWC} content of each biosolid varied by less than a factor of 2. These results indicate that the biosolids investigated in this study have {OWC} compositions and concentrations that are more similar than different and that biosolids are highly enriched in {OWCs} (as mass-normalized concentrations) when compared to effluents or effluent-impacted water. These results demonstrate the need to better describe the composition and fate of {OWCs} in biosolids since about 50\% of biosolids are land applied and thus become a potentially ubiquitous nonpoint source of {OWCs} into the environment.},

	abstract = {This paper argues that the active turbulence and coherent motions near the top of a vegetation canopy are patterned on a plane mixing layer, because of instabilities associated with the characteristic strong inflection in the mean velocity profile. Mixing-layer turbulence, formed around the inflectional mean velocity profile which develops between two coflowing streams of different velocities, differs in several ways from turbulence in a surface layer. Through these differences, the mixing-layer analogy provides an explanation for many of the observed distinctive features of canopy turbulence. These include: (a) ratios between components of the Reynolds stress tensor; (b) the ratio K H/K M of the eddy diffusivities for heat and momentum; (c) the relative roles of ejections and sweeps; (d) the behaviour of the turbulent energy balance, particularly the major role of turbulent transport; and (e) the behaviour of the turbulent length scales of the active coherent motions (the dominant eddies responsible for vertical transfer near the top of the canopy).

Studies of 16 sites in or near the Kadashan River basin demonstrated nonlinear, unimodal relations between flood frequency and {SR}, productivity and {SR}, and linear relations between {SR} and the spatial variation of flood frequencies ({SVFF}) within a site. {SVFF} is caused by microtopographic variation in elevation. A nonlinear regression model relating {SR} to flood frequency and {SVFF} explained much of the variation in {SR} between wetland communities. Sites with intermediate flood frequencies and high {SVFF} were species-rich, while sites frequently, rarely, or permanently flooded and with low {SVFF} were species-poor. The data suggest that small-scale spatial variation can dramatically alter the impact of disturbances. The data also support Michael Huston’s dynamic-equilibrium model of species diversity, which predicts the effects of productivity and disturbance on diversity patterns. Species-rich sites had low to intermediate levels of productivity and intermediate flood frequencies, and species-poor sites had very low or high flood frequencies and low productivity, supporting the model’s predictions. The model was tested at contrasting spatial scales (1000 m2 and 1 m2). At the 1000-m2 scale, Huston’s model predicted 78\% of the variation in {SR}. At the microplot scale, relationships between {SR} and flood frequency were weaker, and the dynamic-equilibrium model predicted only 36\% of the variation in {SR}.},

The sites spanned a salinity gradient from 0 to 20 psu. The impact of nitrogen loading on the role of anammox in marsh sediments was studied in a marsh fertilization experiment and in marshes with high nitrogen loading entering through ground water. In all locations, nitrogen removal through anammox was low compared to denitrification, with anammox accounting for less than 3\% of the total N2 production. The highest relative importance of anammox was found in the sediments of freshwater-dominated marshes, where anammox approached 3\%, whereas anammox was of lesser importance in saline marsh sediments. Increased nitrogen loading, in the form of nitrate from natural or artificial sources, did not impact the relative importance of anammox, which remained low in all the nitrogen enriched locations ({\textless}1\%).},

However, land-use-related reductions in sediment delivery rates to estuaries world-wide suggest that these above-ground feedbacks may not apply in some of the world’s most vulnerable coastal landscapes. 2. To understand the relationships between sea level rise and marsh survival, we measured root and shoot growth over experimentally manipulated elevations in a rapidly submerging, sediment deficient marsh. 3. Root growth was highest at a distinct optimum elevation in both Schoenoplectus americanus and Spartina patens. S. americanus shoot growth was highest at an optimum elevation, but S. patens shoot growth increased with elevation throughout the intertidal zone. 4. For marsh elevations that are higher than optimum (expected at low sea level rise rates), we propose that an acceleration in the rate of sea level rise will lead to enhanced root growth, organic accretion and wetland stability. For suboptimum marsh elevations (expected at rapid sea level rise rates and/or low sediment supply), increases in the water level will lead to reduced root growth and a decrease in the rate of elevation gain. 5. More than 80\% of the marshland in our study area has an elevation below the optimum for root growth, suggesting that this previously unknown feedback could explain observations of rapid marsh deterioration in the region. 6.Synthesis. Below-ground responses of marshes to sea level rise are more broadly applicable than above-ground feedbacks because they are consistent among different species and do not depend on the availability of mineral sediment.},

	abstract = {Mississippi River water and associated sediment are seasonally diverted into Louisiana coastal basins to restore historic hydrologic and salinity regimes and to slow or reverse the widespread wetland loss. More river diversions are planned; however, very little research has been conducted on the potential source of phosphorous (P) of these sediments transported by the Mississippi River into the coastal areas through these diversions. In addition, the sediments have the potential to undergo changes in redox status when these significant flooding events occur. Therefore, we examined the effect of sediment redox condition on P release from newly deposited Mississippi River sediment. Sediment was collected from Big Mar Lake, the receiving water body of the Caernarvon diversion structure, through which river water is diverted into the Breton sound estuary. Sediment suspensions were incubated in the laboratory under reducing conditions, and the relation of redox conditions to P release was determined. Soluble reactive P ({SRP}), dissolved organic P ({DOP}), Fe, and Mn concentrations increased with decreasing sediment redox potential. The {SRP} and {DOP} concentrations increased 32 - and 8-fold during 20 days of anaerobic conditions. The increase in {SRP} and {DOP} availability was significantly correlated to an increase in ferrous iron with no significant relationship with Al, Ca, or Mg. While the vast majority of studies on nutrients associated with the Mississippi River diversions have focused on excess inorganic nitrogen forms (primarily {NO}3) in the river water, this study is one of the first to demonstrate that upon reduction associated with prolonged flooding, the diverted Mississippi River suspended sediment can be a significant source of available P to the coastal basin.},

Interviewing coastal communities who have lived with the breakwaters revealed numerous expectations. Since each community's requirement might be entangled with other functions and incur more costs, coastal engineers had to prioritize preferences. Seven breakwater scenarios were synthesized based on the interview results. For each scenario, the shoreline position was simulated using calibrated {LITPACK} software, the construction cost was estimated, and a set of illustrations was drawn in order to standardize respondents' perceptions. An analytical hierarchical process ({AHP}) was applied. The {AHP} results suggested that the preferred breakwater scenarios were those that promoted the existing ways of life.

Before sediment amendment, the vegetation did not differ in these Taxodium distichum–Nyssa aquatica forests with respect to herbaceous and tree seedling composition, and sapling and tree characteristics. After the application of sediment in January 2007, sediment-amended swamps had higher elevations and salinity levels than natural swamps. The layer of sediment applied to Treasure Island in Jean Lafitte National Historic Park and Preserve was relatively deep (sediment depth at Site One and Site Two: 0.89 and 0.69 m, respectively, six months after application), and may have exceeded an optimal threshold. Sediment-amended swamp with the highest elevation had some tree mortality and little tree growth of T. distichum. Also, sediment-amended swamp had higher root biomasses of ruderal species, and lower species richness and cover of herbaceous species. Nevertheless, during controlled water releases during an oil spill emergency in 2010, both sediment-amended and reference forest had higher production levels than in other years. While sediment amendment is a compelling management alternative for sinking coastal wetlands, optimal thresholds were not determined for these T. distichum–N. aquatica swamps.},

	abstract = {Abstract A growth experiment with native plants in pots exposed to natural environmental conditions evaluates the use of sewage sludge as a soil amendment in restoration of a southern California salt marsh. Sludge containing desirable organic matter but also undesirable heavy metal contaminants was mixed with a readily available matrix soil to reduce metal concentrations to levels below legal limits for land applications of sludge. Soil nutrient analysis revealed expected increases in total nitrogen and total phosphorus content with increasing sludge concentration. Soil metals analysis, however, revealed decreases in metal content with increased sludge concentration, a trend evidently caused by higher than expected metal content in the matrix soil. Five artificial soil mixtures ranging from 0 to 70\% sludge were accompanied by natural wetland soil controls. Pots containing these soils were placed into a natural salt marsh. The pots were then planted with two native salt marsh plant species, Salicornia virginica and Frankenia grandifolia. Aboveground biomass was harvested after 12 months. Plant growth displayed no obvious change with increasing sludge concentration. Over the concentration ranges used, increased nutrient content did not stimulate plant growth and increased metal content did not inhibit plant growth. Plants grew better in natural wetland soil than in artificial soil mixtures, a trend probably caused by the substantially finer texture and higher organic content of natural soil. All sludge treatments differed more from the natural soil than from each other, implying that within the ranges examined, soil texture and organic content exerted more influence on plant growth than did metal or nutrient concentration. These results suggest that incorporating this sewage sludge in the soil of the restored salt marsh will neither benefit nor harm the plants that will live there and that greatest plant growth will be achieved by mixing the sludge with a fine-grained matrix soil.},

The aboveground biomasses for Spartina patens, S. alterniflora, Phragmites australis, and Distichlis spicata were 2.3, 2.2, 1.7 and 1.2 kg m−2, respectively. The ratio of belowground to aboveground biomass for S. alterniflora and D. spicata, harvested from a recently restored wetland were lower than in previous studies. {LAI} for S. alterniflora, D. spicata, P. australis, and S. patens were 8.4, 6.8, 4.8 and 3.7 m2 m−2, respectively.

Although generally associated with the accretion processes necessary for marshes to keep up with relative sea level rise, competing environmental constraints, and ecologic controls, zonation is still poorly understood in terms of the underlying biogeomorphic mechanisms. Here we find, through observations and modeling interpretation, that zonation is the result of coupled geomorphological–biological dynamics and that it stems from the ability of vegetation to actively engineer the landscape by tuning soil elevation within preferential ranges of optimal adaptation. We find multiple peaks in the frequency distribution of observed topographic elevation and identify them as the signature of biologic controls on geomorphodynamics through competing stable states modulated by the interplay of inorganic and organic deposition. Interestingly, the stable biogeomorphic equilibria correspond to suboptimal rates of biomass production, a result coherent with recent observations. The emerging biogeomorphic structures may display varying degrees of robustness to changes in the rate of sea level rise and sediment availability, with implications for the overall resilience of marsh ecosystems to climatic changes.},

(2) Increases in standing crop were detected in the second year of treatment and remained for three years of treatment. The increases in biomass are believed to be due to the nitrogen additions. (3) Spartina alterniflora, which was the dominant species in low marsh areas, progressively excluded Salicornia spp. from the fertilized plots after an initial increase of Salicornia. In high marsh areas, fertilization initially increased the standing crop of Distichlis spicata but this was later replaced by Spartina patens. S. alterniflora did not respond to fertilization in the high marsh. (4) The amount of dead matter in both high and low marsh was highest in the fall, after death of the sward, and decreased slowly to a low point in midsummer. The amount of dead matter was never equal to peak live biomass, implying decomposition or tidal export. (5) The production achieved by the most heavily fertilized plots are among the highest recorded for marsh plants, except that of tall form S. alterniflora in exceptionally favourable sites. (6) Our treatments have converted low marsh vegetation, consisting mainly of dwarf form S. alterniflora, into a sward approaching the biomass and morphology of tall form. We conclude that the so-called `forms' are a response to nitrogen supply.},

Among the study areas, Stege Marsh, located in San Francisco Bay, was the most contaminated. Compared to San Francisco Bay, Stege Marsh had much higher levels of organic contaminants such as {PCBs} (polychlorinated biphenyls), {DDTs}, and chlordanes. At reference marshes (Tom’s Point and Walker Creek in Tomales Bay), organic contaminants in sediments were very low. While {PAHs} (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) were found at all of the study areas (22–13 600 ng g−1), measurable concentrations of {PCBs} were found only in the sediments from Stege Marsh (80–9940 ng g−1). Combustion related (pyrogenic) high molecular weight {PAHs} were dominant in sediments from Stege and Carpinteria Marshes, while in sediments from Tom’s Point and Walker Creek petroleum related (petrogenic) low molecular weight {PAHs} and alkyl-substituted {PAHs} were much more abundant than pyrogenic {PAHs}. {PCB} congener patterns in all of the Stege Marsh samples were the same and revealed that Aroclor 1248 was a predominant source. In all marshes, the sum of {DDE} and {DDD} accounted for more than 90\% of total {DDTs}, indicating that {DDT} has degraded significantly. The ratios of p,p′-{DDE} to p,p′-{DDD} in sediments from Stege Marsh provide evidence of possible previous use of technical {DDD}. Chlordane ratios indicated that chlordanes have degraded slightly. Bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (280–32 000 ng g−1) was the most abundant phthalate. The data indicates that Stege Marsh may be a source of contaminants that continue to be discharged into San Francisco Bay.},

	abstract = {The evolution of tidal marsh platforms and interwoven channel networks cannot be addressed without treating the two-way interactions that link biological and physical processes. We have developed a 3D model of tidal marsh accretion and channel network development that couples physical sediment transport processes with vegetation biomass productivity. Tidal flow tends to cause erosion, whereas vegetation biomass, a function of bed surface depth below high tide, influences the rate of sediment deposition and slope-driven transport processes such as creek bank slumping. With a steady, moderate rise in sea level, the model builds a marsh platform and channel network with accretion rates everywhere equal to the rate of sea-level rise, meaning water depths and biological productivity remain temporally constant. An increase in the rate of sea-level rise, or a reduction in sediment supply, causes marsh-surface depths, biomass productivity, and deposition rates to increase while simultaneously causing the channel network to expand. Vegetation on the marsh platform can promote a metastable equilibrium where the platform maintains elevation relative to a rapidly rising sea level, although disturbance to vegetation could cause irreversible loss of marsh habitat.},

	abstract = {Cordgrasses in the genus Spartina are good examples of ecosystem engineers that modify habitat structure in estuaries throughout the world. In San Francisco Bay, California, {USA}, marshes containing native California cordgrass (Spartina foliosa) are being invaded by a hybrid (S. alterniflora × S. foliosa) formed after introduction of S. alterniflora. This study compared vegetation, sediment structure, and infaunal invertebrates in native and invaded marshes. We hypothesized that differences in the physical structure between S. foliosa and hybrid Spartina would be reflected in differences in density, biomass, diversity, and taxonomic composition of infauna. Hybrid Spartina modifies habitat structure more than S. foliosa by producing taller stems, and greater plant biomass both above- and belowground while occupying a much wider tidal range, thereby transforming open mudflats to a vegetated habitat. In general, S. foliosa areas contained significantly higher densities of benthic infauna than adjacent mudflats, while hybrid Spartina areas never contained greater infaunal densities than mudflats. This is because S. foliosa produces a moderate level of structure that can facilitate benthic invertebrates, whereas hybrid Spartina produces so much structure, particularly belowground, that it actually excludes invertebrates. Therefore, we suggest that these two closely related species both act as ecosystem engineers, but with opposing effects on invertebrate communities.},

	abstract = {A study quantifying the role of the interactive effects of salinity and soil drying on nutrient uptake in Spartina alterniflora was conducted in a climate-controlled greenhouse. The experiment consisted of three levels of salinity (3–5 g/L, L; 15–20 g/L, M; 35–38 g/L, H) as well as three dynamic water levels: drought (water level maintained at least 20 cm below the soil surface at high tide, D), intermediate soil drying (water level maintained between 20 cm below the soil surface at low tide and 10 cm below the soil surface at high tide, I), and flooding (water level maintained 3–5 cm above the soil surface at high tide and 10 cm below the soil surface at low tide, F). Survival, shoot and root dry matter production, and concentrations of Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, N, P, K, Na, and S were measured along with soil conditions of redox potential and water potential. Contrary to expectations, the interactive effects of salinity and soil drying were not additive on plant nutrient uptake or biomass. However, both salinity and soil drying significantly impacted root and shoot dry weights. In addition, significant decreases were seen in all nutrients in response to increases in salinity and/or soil drying. High salinity in conjunction with drought ({HD}) decreased survival to 71\%, whereas survival was 100\% for all other treatments. Furthermore, leaf chlorosis and browning occurred in plants under increased salinity and drought conditions ({HD} and {MD}). Therefore, it appears that drought may magnify the adverse effects of salinity on plant nutrient status. Although the combined effects of increased salinity and soil drying did not appear to be detrimental to this species, significant decreases in nutrient uptake seen in response to the combined effects at severe levels ({HD}), if continued over an extended period, may be detrimental enough to cause large-scale marsh browning as noted in the field.},

Thus, we hypothesized that organic and nitrogen amendments would accelerate plant growth and enrich soil nitrogen pools. A field experiment in a newly excavated mitigation site examined the effects of adding ammonium sulfate (N), nitrogen-rich alfalfa (with or without added N), and nitrogen-poor straw (with or without added N) prior to planting. Aboveground biomass and stem densities of cordgrass were proportional to the amount of N added, whether in the organic or inorganic form. Alfalfa decomposed more rapidly than straw, but in both cases, N was lost quickly (50-66\% in 2 wk). Sediment nitrogen and carbon pools were not increased significantly by the amendments. High decomposition rates and sandy soils apparently prevented accumulation of N in the nutrient and/or organic matter pools. Less than 5\% of the nitrogen potentially available for uptake was actually recovered in aerial tissue. With N-poor soil and high nutrient-loss rates, the experimental plots developed less than half the aboveground biomass found in reference natural cordgrass marshes. Amending soils prior to transplantation did not achieve the goal of functional equivalency with natural marshes, and after 2 yr there was no indication that nutrient pools or plant growth rates would achieve natural levels.},

	abstract = {High rates of wave-induced erosion along salt marsh boundaries challenge the idea that marsh survival is dictated by the competition between vertical sediment accretion and relative sea-level rise. Because waves pounding marshes are often locally generated in enclosed basins, the depth and width of surrounding tidal flats have a pivoting control on marsh erosion. Here, we show the existence of a threshold width for tidal flats bordering salt marshes. Once this threshold is exceeded, irreversible marsh erosion takes place even in the absence of sea-level rise. This catastrophic collapse occurs because of the positive feedbacks among tidal flat widening by wave-induced marsh erosion, tidal flat deepening driven by wave bed shear stress, and local wind wave generation. The threshold width is determined by analyzing the 50-y evolution of 54 marsh basins along the {US} Atlantic Coast. The presence of a critical basin width is predicted by a dynamic model that accounts for both horizontal marsh migration and vertical adjustment of marshes and tidal flats. Variability in sediment supply, rather than in relative sea-level rise or wind regime, explains the different critical width, and hence erosion vulnerability, found at different sites. We conclude that sediment starvation of coastlines produced by river dredging and damming is a major anthropogenic driver of marsh loss at the study sites and generates effects at least comparable to the accelerating sea-level rise due to global warming.},

	abstract = {Proline accumulation by eight major species of salt marsh halophytes was examined under growth chamber and field conditions. When the plants were exposed to increasing salinities in the growth chamber, they accumulated proline after a threshold salinity had been reached. Three general patterns were apparent. Limonium carolinianum (Walt.) Britt. and Juncus roemerianus Scheele began to accumulate proline at 0.25 M {NaCl} with accumulations up to 63.6 \&\#x3bc; moles per gram fresh weight at higher salinities. The C4 grasses, Spartina alterniflora Loisel., Spartina patens (Aiton) Muhl., and Distichlis spicata (L.) Greene, had threshold salinity levels around 0.5 M {NaCl} and accumulated proline to 27.4 \&\#x3bc; moles per gram fresh weight. The succulents. Salicornia bigelovii Torr., Salicornia virginica L., and Borrichia frutescens (L.) {DC}., did not accumulate proline until very high salinities (0.7 M) were reached. Water stress imposed by polyethylene glycol instead of {NaCl} caused similar proline accumulation in the species studied, but to different extents. Field measurements of proline content and soil salinities correlated well with the findings from growth chamber experiments. Rates of proline accumulation and breakdown in L. carolinianum were sufficient for osmotic adjustment by the plant to the changes in interstitial salinity in the marsh. The significance of proline accumulation as an adaptation to the salt marsh environment was species specific. We suggest that proline accumulation is of considerable importance in L. carolinianum and J. roemerianus, important to the C4 grasses at certain times and in certain locations in the marsh, and of little importance in the succulents.},

Here we present a new method to calculate subsidence rates from the tide gauge record that is based on an understanding of the meteorological drivers of inter-annual sea-level change. In Grand Isle, {LA} and Galveston, {TX}, we explicitly show that temporal patterns of subsidence are closely linked to subsurface fluid withdrawal and coastal land loss, and suggest changes in withdrawal rates can both increase and decrease rates of subsidence and wetland loss. Our results also imply that the volume of sediment needed to rebuild {GOM} wetlands may currently fall within the low end of some restoration scenarios.},

	abstract = {The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (District) services Chicago and 124 suburban communities in Cook County, Illinois. The District collects and treats wastewater from a population equivalent to 11 million people and generates approximately 180,000 dry tons of biosolids annually. The District is committed to managing biosolids beneficially and economically. The District operates a diverse biosolids management program which consists of applying biosolids to strip mined land at its 15,006 acre site in Fulton County for the production of grain crops; applying biosolids to agricultural land in northeastern Illinois also for the production of grain crops; and using biosolids as a soil conditioner or soil substitute in the Chicago Metropolitan Area (Chicagoland).The use of biosolids in Chicagoland is attractive because it is the most economical management option, and it offers benefits to the District's local constituency. The local market includes the following uses of biosolids: Final protective layer of landfill covers Daily landfill cover Construction and renovation of recreational facilities (e.g. public parks, golf courses, athletic fields) Brownfield reclamation Commercial landscaping Roadside landscaping In order to be able to utilize biosolids in this market, the District had to address several regulatory requirements. The most important of these are the state and federal regulations for the land application of biosolids and biosolids use at Illinois landfills. In order for biosolids to be used with a minimum of regulatory and operational restrictions, the District made a commitment to only produce the highest quality biosolids for this market.The District undertook extraordinary measures to enforce its industrial waste control ordinances, and sought to obtain certification from the United States Environmental Protection Agency for its standard biosolids processing trains as equivalent to {PFRP}. As a result, the District produces {EQ} biosolids. The District also obtained Adjusted Standard 95–4 from the Illinois Pollution Control Board for the use of biosolids as a topsoil substitute in the final protective layer of landfills in Illinois. The District has established a partnership with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, and it operates the local land application program under a unique umbrella permit that covers all projects and minimizes regulatory hurdles for its customers.The District has undertaken several initiatives to increase public acceptance and demand for biosolids in Chicagoland. These initiatives have included constructing a large greenhouse for conducting research to support the local uses of biosolids and year-round demonstrations for public education and promotion. The District received the 2001 Research and Technology Award from the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies for the research and demonstrational activities it has done in the greenhouse. The District has established several visible field research and demonstration projects in Chicagoland. The most notable is a large demonstration of the use of biosolids for reclaiming brownfield sites having steel mill slag based soils (the southeast side of Chicago contains several thousand acres of these brownfields). The study was undertaken in partnership with the Chicago Park District. It has been conducted since 2000, and it includes a significant research component. The project and the two field days that have been held at the site have promoted interest in the District's biosolids. The District has also produced a promotional brochure, which it distributes to prospective new users at first time meetings, or at displays presented at local conferences, meetings, or other public events. The District has also expanded the staff of the Biosolids Utilization and Soil Science Section of its R\&D Department to provide technical support to local biosolids users and to follow the conduct of each local project. The District has been producing short case studies of selected local use projects, and it recently published its first booklet of case studies for promotional use. The booklet has been very popular, and it has been successful in generating increased interest in the biosolids.},

	abstract = {Methane, carbon dioxide, and oxygen are exchanged between wetlands and the atmosphere through multiple pathways. One of these pathways, the hydrodynamic transport of dissolved gas through the surface water, is often underestimated in importance. We constructed a model wetland in the laboratory with artificial emergent plants to investigate the mechanisms and magnitude of this transport. We measured gas transfer velocities, which characterize the near-surface stirring driving air-water gas transfer, while varying two stirring processes important to gas exchange in other aquatic environments: wind and thermal convection. To isolate the effects of thermal convection, we identified a semiempirical model for the gas transfer velocity as a function of surface heat loss. The laboratory results indicate that thermal convection will be the dominant mechanism of air-water gas exchange in marshes with emergent vegetation. Thermal convection yielded peak gas transfer velocities of 1 cm h−1. Because of the sheltering of the water surface by emergent vegetation, gas transfer velocities for wind-driven stirring alone are likely to exceed this value only in extreme cases.},

Decision-makers need credible and legitimate measurements of ecosystem services to evaluate decisions for trade-offs to make wise choices. Managers lack these measurements because of a data gap linking ecosystem characteristics to final ecosystem services. The dominant method to address the data gap is benefit transfer using ecological data from one location to estimate ecosystem services at other locations with similar land cover. However, benefit transfer is only valid once the data gap is adequately resolved. Disciplinary frames separating ecology from economics and policy have resulted in confusion on concepts and methods preventing progress on the data gap. In this study, we present a 10-step approach to unify concepts, methods and data from the disparate disciplines to offer guidance on overcoming the data gap. We suggest: (1) estimate ecosystem characteristics using biophysical models, (2) identify final ecosystem services using endpoints and (3) connect them using ecological production functions to quantify biophysical trade-offs. The guidance is strategic for public policy because analysts need to be: (1) realistic when setting priorities, (2) attentive to timelines to acquire relevant data, given resources and (3) responsive to the needs of decision-makers.},

	abstract = {The morphology, entrainment, and settling of suspended aggregates (“floc”) significantly impact fluxes of organic carbon, nutrients, and contaminants in aquatic environments. However, transport properties of highly organic floc remain poorly understood. In this study detrital floc was collected in the Florida Everglades from two sites with different abundances of periphyton for use in a settling column and in racetrack flume entrainment experiments. Although Everglades flocs are similar to other organic aggregates in terms of morphology and settling rates, they tend to be larger and more porous than typical mineral flocs because of biostabilization processes and relatively low prevailing shear stresses typical of wetlands. Flume experiments documented that Everglades floc was entrained at a low bed shear stress of 1.0 × 10−2 Pa, which is considerably smaller than the typical entrainment threshold of mineral floc. Because of similarities between Everglades floc and other organic floc populations, floc transport characteristics in the Everglades typify the behavior of floc in other organic-rich shallow-water environments. Highly organic floc is more mobile than less organic floc, but because bed shear stresses in wetlands are commonly near the entrainment threshold, wetland floc dynamics are often transport-limited rather than supply limited. Organic floc transport in these environments is therefore governed by the balance between entrainment and settling fluxes, which has implications for ecosystem metabolism, materials cycling, and even landscape evolution.},

	abstract = {Wetlands are characterized by extremely high biodiversity and primary productivity (comparable to tropical rain forests), provide critical habitats for rare and endangered vegetation and animal species, and mediate the effects of floods and the action of the sea on the coast. A deep understanding of wetland system functioning cannot be acquired by simply reducing its dynamics to a collection of parts but requires the explicit description of wetland physical and ecological processes as fully interacting components. In fact, the complex spatial ecohydrological patterns characterizing wetland areas arise as a result of the coupled evolution of their ecological, hydrological, and morphological features. Here we examine observations of prominent spatial patterns in wetland vegetation and link them to the relevant hydrological and ecological processes. We describe the limitations to vegetation development due to scarce soil oxygen availability and implement a mathematical model, based on Richards' equation, coupling subsurface water flow and plant water uptake in a tidal salt marsh. The soil aeration patterns arising from such interactions highlight the central role of vegetation in increasing soil aeration, possibly inducing the establishment of a permanently aerated soil layer (in spite of tidal flooding), and the influence of different soil characteristics on soil oxygen availability. Finally, we discuss how ecohydrological interactions can contribute to explain patterns of vegetation colonization and spatial heterogeneity.},

The impact of wetlands on storm surge depends on multiple factors including vegetation, landscape, and storm characteristics. The Delft3D model, in which vegetation effects on flow and turbulence are explicitly incorporated, was applied to the semi-enclosed Breton Sound ({BS}) estuary in coastal Louisiana to investigate the wetland impact. Guided by extensive field observations, a series of numerical experiments were conducted based on variations of actual vegetation properties and storm parameters from Hurricane Isaac in 2012. Both the vegetation-induced maximum surge reduction ({MSR}) and maximum surge reduction rate ({MSRR}) increased with stem height and stem density, and were more sensitive to stem height. The {MSR} and {MSRR} decreased significantly with increasing wind intensity. The {MSRR} was the highest with a fast-moving weak storm. It was also found that the {MSRR} varied proportionally to the expression involving the maximum bulk velocity and surge over the area of interest, and was more dependent on the maximum bulk surge. Both {MSR} and {MSRR} appeared to increase when the area of interest decreased from the whole {BS} estuary to the upper estuary. Within the range of the numerical experiments, the maximum simulated {MSR} and {MSRR} over the upper estuary were 0.7 m and 37\%, respectively.},

(2) Increases in standing crop were detected in the second year of treatment and remained for three years of treatment. The increases in biomass are believed to be due to the nitrogen additions. (3) Spartina alterniflora, which was the dominant species in low marsh areas, progressively excluded Salicornia spp. from the fertilized plots after an initial increase of Salicornia. In high marsh areas, fertilization initially increased the standing crop of Distichlis spicata but this was later replaced by Spartina patens. S. alterniflora did not respond to fertilization in the high marsh. (4) The amount of dead matter in both high and low marsh was highest in the fall, after death of the sward, and decreased slowly to a low point in midsummer. The amount of dead matter was never equal to peak live biomass, implying decomposition or tidal export. (5) The production achieved by the most heavily fertilized plots are among the highest recorded for marsh plants, except that of tall form S. alterniflora in exceptionally favourable sites. (6) Our treatments have converted low marsh vegetation, consisting mainly of dwarf form S. alterniflora, into a sward approaching the biomass and morphology of tall form.

	abstract = {Black mangroves (Avicennia spp.) are hypothesized to expand their latitudinal range with global climate change in the 21st century, induced by a reduction in the frequency and severity of coastal freezes, which are known to limit mangrove colony extent and individual tree size. The Gulf of Mexico is a prime candidate for population expansion to occur because it is located at the northward limit of black mangrove habitat. This may come at the expense of existing coastal saline wetlands that are dominantly Spartina spp. marsh grasses. The present study was conducted to focus on the implications of a marsh to mangrove transition in Gulf wetlands, specifically: (1) wetland resistance to accelerating eustatic sea level rise ({ESLR}) rates; (2) resistance to wave attack in large storms (increased cyclonic storm frequency/intensity is predicted with future climate warming); and (3) organic carbon sequestration and wetland soil geochemistry. Field sites of adjacent and inter-grown Avicennia germinans mangrove and Spartina marsh populations in similar geomorphological setting were selected in back-barrier areas near Port Aransas and Galveston, {TX}. Elevation surveys in the more mature Port Aransas site indicate mangrove vegetated areas are 4 cm higher in elevation than surrounding marsh on an average regional scale, and 1–2 cm higher at the individual mangrove scale. 210Pb and 137Cs accumulation rates and loss on ignition data indicate that mineral trapping is 4.1 times higher and sediment organics are 1.7 times lower in mangroves at Port Aransas. This additional mineral trapping does not differ in grain size character from marsh accumulation. Elevation change may also be effected by soil displacement of higher root volumes in mangrove cores. Port Aransas porosities are lower in mangrove rooted horizons, with a corresponding increase in sediment strength, suggesting mangrove intervals are more resistant to wave-induced erosion during storm events. Port Aransas mangroves exhibit higher pore water redox potentials and salinities over entire core depths and depressed {pH} over rooted intervals, suggesting a distinct diagenetic environment exists relative to marsh sites. The rooting network, which introduces oxygen into the sediment and focuses evapo-transpiration and salt exclusion within this zone, may prove advantageous when competing with grasses by elevating salinities to levels that are toxic for Spartina. Trends observed in the more mature systems of Port Aransas are generally absent in Galveston, suggesting the youth and physically shorter stature of these systems means they have not yet established a unique sediment signature.},

	abstract = {While it has been demonstrated in numerous studies that the aboveground characteristics of the vegetation are of particular importance with respect to soil erosion control, this study argues the importance of separating the influence of vegetation on soil erosion rates into two parts: the impact of leaves and stems (aboveground biomass) and the influence of roots (belowground biomass). Although both plant parameters form inseparable constituents of the total plant organism, most studies attribute the impact of vegetation on soil erosion rates mainly to the characteristics of the aboveground biomass. This triggers the question whether the belowground biomass is of no or negligible importance with respect to soil erosion by concentrated flow. This study tried to answer this question by comparing cross-sectional areas of concentrated flow channels (rills and ephemeral gullies) in the Belgian Loess Belt for different cereal and grass plant densities. The results of these measurements highlighted the fact that both an increase in shoot density as well as an increase in root density resulted in an exponential decrease of concentrated flow erosion rates. Since protection of the soil surface in the early plant growth stages is crucial with respect to the reduction of water erosion rates, increasing the plant root density in the topsoil could be a viable erosion control strategy.

Although soil salinity increased where tidal flushing was excluded for 10 months (salinities rose ∼20 to 50\%), pickleweed cover and algal chlorophyll did not differ among treatments. Effects were seen only in pickleweed growth rates (∼30\% decrease where tides were excluded) and normalized difference vegetation index ({NDVI}) measurements. We failed to show any differences between impounded and fully tidal conditions, because the mesocosms had coarse sediments, and impounded water drained easily via subsurface flow. However, the problems that we encountered with the mesocosms led to the following advice for future wetland restoration projects: (1) Mesocosms are useful for testing restoration techniques before an actual restoration project takes place. (2) Mesocosms should be used to test factors that may lead to more successful restoration in the future, including planting techniques, substrate conditions, and hydrology. (3) Mesocosms should be used to develop new assessment methods for monitoring wetland ecosystems. Because of the ability to control some environmental parameters while maintaining seminatural conditions, mesocosms offer great potential for the future evaluation of experimental restoration techniques.},

	abstract = {Computed tomography ({CT}) imaging has been used to describe and quantify subtidal, benthic animals such as polychaetes, amphipods, and shrimp. Here, for the first time, {CT} imaging is used to quantify wet mass of coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in cores collected from organic-rich (Jamaica Bay, New York) and mineral (North Inlet, South Carolina) Spartina alterniflora soils. Image analysis software was coupled with the {CT} images to measure abundance and diameter of the coarse roots and rhizomes in marsh soils. Previously, examination of marsh roots and rhizomes was limited to various hand-sieving methods that were often time-consuming, tedious, and error prone. {CT} imaging can discern the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat based on their varying particle densities. Calibration rods composed of materials with standard densities (i.e., air, water, colloidal silica, and glass) were used to operationally define the specific x-ray attenuations of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in the marsh cores. Significant regression relationships were found between the {CT}-determined wet mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes and the hand-sieved dry mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes in both the organic-rich and mineral marsh soils. There was also a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the {CT}-determined peat particle density among organic-rich and mineral soils. In only the mineral soils, there was a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the {CT}-determined peat wet mass. Using {CT} imaging, significant positive nitrogen fertilization effects on the wet masses of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat, and the abundance and diameter of rhizomes were measured in the mineral soils. In contrast, a deteriorating salt marsh island in Jamaica Bay had significantly less mass of coarse roots and rhizomes at depth (10–20 cm), and a significantly lower abundance of roots and rhizomes compared with a stable marsh. However, the diameters of the rhizomes in the deteriorating marsh were significantly greater than in the stable marsh. {CT} imaging is a rapid approach to quantify coarse roots, rhizomes, peat, and soil particle densities in coastal wetlands, but the method is unable at this time to quantify fine roots.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the tidal effects on aeration conditions for plant root respiration in a tidal marsh. We extend the work of Ursino et al. (2004) by using a two-phase model for air and water flows in the marsh. Simulations have been conducted to examine directly the link between the airflow dynamics and the aeration condition in the marsh soil. The results show that the effects of entrapped air on water movement in the vadose zone are significant in certain circumstances. Single-phase models based on Richards' equation, which neglect such effects, may not be adequate for quantifying the aeration condition in tidal marsh. The optimal aeration condition, represented by the maximum of the integral magnitude of tidally advected air mass ({TAAM}) flux, is found to occur near the tidal creek for the four soil textures simulated. This may explain the observation that some salt marsh plant species grow better near tidal creeks than in the inner marsh areas. Our analyses, based on the two-phase model and predicted {TAAM} flux magnitude, provide further insight into the “positive feedback” mechanism proposed by Ursino et al. (2004). That is, pioneer plants may grow successfully near the creek where the root aeration condition is optimal. The roots of the pioneer plants can soften and loosen the rhizosphere soil, which increases the evapotranspiration rate, the soil porosity, and absolute permeability and weakens the capillary effects. These, in turn, improve further the root aeration conditions and may lead to colonization by plants less resistant to anaerobic conditions.},

This study examined how the addition of different amounts of compost at a restoration site in Charlotte, North Carolina, affected the development of soil properties, microbial communities, and plant growth and diversity. The stream and wetland restoration was completed in July 2004 and monitored for three years. Available nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) increased with increasing {SOM}. The microbial community responded to organic matter ({OM}) additions with increases in both total microbial biomass and microbial activity (as measured by denitrification potential). Plant community responses were less consistent. In 2004, leaf \% N significantly increased with increasing {OM} for two species (Pontederia cordata and Sagittaria latifolia) while two other species (Acorus calamus and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani) showed no relationship; in 2005, however, there was no relationship for any of the species. We also found no relationship between total plant aboveground biomass and \% {SOM} measured in 2006. We found negative relationships between species richness and \% {SOM} in 2004 and 2006, but not in 2005. These results suggest that compost amendments are an effective method for improving soil properties, stimulating microbial communities, and can improve some ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling, but may have limited early effects on plant communities.},

	shorttitle = {Long-distance transport of gases in plants},
	abstract = {Internal transport of gases is crucial for vascular plants inhabiting aquatic, wetland or flood-prone environments. Diffusivity of gases in water is approximately 10 000 times slower than in air; thus direct exchange of gases between submerged tissues and the environment is strongly impeded. Aerenchyma provides a low-resistance internal pathway for gas transport between shoot and root extremities. By this pathway, O2 is supplied to the roots and rhizosphere, while {CO}2, ethylene, and methane move from the soil to the shoots and atmosphere. Diffusion is the mechanism by which gases move within roots of all plant species, but significant pressurized through-flow occurs in stems and rhizomes of several emergent and floating-leaved wetland plants. Through-flows can raise O2 concentrations in the rhizomes close to ambient levels. In general, rates of flow are determined by plant characteristics such as capacity to generate positive pressures in shoot tissues, and resistance to flow in the aerenchyma, as well as environmental conditions affecting leaf-to-air gradients in humidity and temperature. O2 diffusion in roots is influenced by anatomical, morphological and physiological characteristics, and environmental conditions. Roots of many (but not all) wetland species contain large volumes of aerenchyma (e.g. root porosity can reach 55\%), while a barrier impermeable to radial O2 loss ({ROL}) often occurs in basal zones. These traits act synergistically to enhance the amount of O2 diffusing to the root apex and enable the development of an aerobic rhizosphere around the root tip, which enhances root penetration into anaerobic substrates. The barrier to {ROL} in roots of some species is induced by growth in stagnant conditions, whereas it is constitutive in others. An inducible change in the resistance to O2 across the hypodermis/exodermis is hypothesized to be of adaptive significance to plants inhabiting transiently waterlogged soils. Knowledge on the anatomical basis of the barrier to {ROL} in various species is scant. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that the barrier may also impede influx of: (i) soil-derived gases, such as {CO}2, methane, and ethylene; (ii) potentially toxic substances (e.g. reduced metal ions) often present in waterlogged soils; and (iii) nutrients and water. Lateral roots, that remain permeable to O2, may be the main surface for exchange of substances between the roots and rhizosphere in wetland species. Further work is required to determine whether diversity in structure and function in roots of wetland species can be related to various niche habitats.},

	abstract = {A consistent database was established to characterize key environmental factors known to control delta morphology. The database includes the location, basin morphology, fluvial and sediment discharge to the deltas, delta morphology, ocean energy, and shelf depth reached by the sub-aqueous delta. Fifty-one deltas were selected to cover the global parameter range of rivers entering all major oceans and coastal seas. Seasonal satellite images of the deltas were processed ({IKONOS}, {SPOT}, {LANDSAT}, and {MODIS}). Predictive statistical relationships were obtained, suitable for hypothesis testing or to constrain/verify numerical models used to simulate the evolution of coastal systems. The area of a delta is best predicted from average discharge, the total sediment load feeding the delta, and the offshore accommodation space. The gradient of a delta plain, measured from the apex of the delta to the coast along the main channel, is best predicted with a ratio of sediment supply to sediment retention, sediment concentration used as a proxy of delta plain sedimentation, and mean water discharge. Widths of distributary channels form a lognormal distribution, with the cumulative width of the river mouths directly related to the maximum discharge, tidal and wave energy. The grain size of topset deposits scales with the river length. Hundreds of millions of people occupy deltas and human engineering is now a major influence on the growth and evolution of many deltas, through control of the flow path of distributary channels, and mitigation of the seasonal flood wave with concomitant change in the delivery of sediment load. More and more deltas are moving away from their pre-Anthropocene morphology, as influenced by pristine sediment supply and sediment dispersal.},

	abstract = {The Bayou Boeuf Basin ({BBB}), a sub-basin of the Barataria Basin estuary in coastal Louisiana, consists of forested and floating wetlands receiving drainage from surrounding agricultural fields and urban watersheds. We characterized surface water quality in the {BBB}, and determined through hydrologic modeling if a series of levee breaks along major drainage channels would significantly improve water quality by allowing flow into surrounding wetlands. Surface water monitoring found surrounding sugarcane farm fields to be major sources of nutrient and sediment loading. Hydrological modeling indicated that levee breaks would increase N reduction from the current 21.4\%–29.2\%, which is much lower than the anticipated 90–100\% removal rate. This was due to several factors, one them being dredging of main drainage channels to such a degree that water levels do not rise much above the surrounding wetland elevation even during severe storms, so only a very small fraction of the stormwater carried in the channel is exposed to wetlands. These unexpected results provide insight into an undoubtedly pervasive problem in human dominated wetland systems; that of decreased flooding during storm events due to channel deepening by dredging activities. Additional water quality management practices should be implemented at the farm field level, prior to water entering major drainage canals.},

We examined the effects of soil texture on (i) estimated rates of root and soil respiration and (ii) soil {CO}2 concentrations, during cycles of soil wetting and drying in the citrus rootstock, Volkamer lemon (Citrus volkameriana Tan. and Pasq.). Plants were grown in soil columns filled with three different soil mixtures varying in their sand, silt and clay content. Root and soil respiration rates, soil water content, plant water uptake and soil {CO}2 concentrations were measured and dynamic relationships among these variables were developed for each soil texture treatment. We found that although the different soil textures differed in their plant-soil water relations characteristics, plant growth was only slightly affected. Root and soil respiration rates were similar under most soil moisture conditions for soils varying widely in percentages of sand, silt and clay. Only following irrigation did {CO}2 efflux from the soil surface vary among soils. That is, efflux of {CO}2 from the soil surface was much more restricted after watering (therefore rendering any respiration measurements inaccurate) in finer textured soils than in sandy soils because of reduced porosity in the finer textured soils. Accordingly, {CO}2 reached and maintained the highest concentrations in finer textured soils ({\textgreater} 40 mmol {CO}2 mol−1). This study revealed that changes in soil moisture can affect interpretations of root and soil measurements based on {CO}2 efflux, particularly in fine textured soils. The implications of the present findings for field soil {CO}2 flux measurements are discussed.},

	abstract = {Spartina alterniflora was first introduced into south San Francisco Bay in the 1970’s. Since that time it has spread to new areas within the south bay and is especially well established at four sites. The spread of this introduced species was evaluated by comparing its vegetative and reproductive characteristics to the native cordgrass, Spartina foliosa. The characters studied were intertidal distribution, phenology, aboveground and belowground biomass, growth rates, seed production, and germination rates. Spartina alterniflora has a wider intertidal distribution than S. foliosa and outproduced the native cordgrass in all aspects that were studied. These results indicate that the introduced species has a much better chance of becoming established in new areas than the native species, and once established, it spreads more rapidly vegetatively than the native species. Spartina alterniflora is likely to continue to spread to new areas in the bay and displace the native plant. In addition, this introduced species may effect sedimentation dynamics, available detritus, benthic algal production, wrack deposition and disturbance, habitat structure for native wetland animals, benthic invertebrate populations, and shorebird and wading bird foraging areas. *** {DIRECT} {SUPPORT} *** A01BY058 00013},

Increased inundation, one effect of accelerated sea level rise, had negative effects on most plant growth parameters, but the magnitude varied with soil and nutrient levels, and between plants from different locations. Average differences between inundation treatments were strongest at high nutrient conditions in low organic matter soils. We conclude that saltmarsh vegetation would be more drastically affected by increased inundation in low than in medium organic matter soils, and especially in estuaries already under high nutrient availability. This knowledge enhances the prediction of changes at the foreshore of saltmarshes related to sea level rise, and the development of site-specific conservation strategies.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}:Both permanent high marsh pools and the intertidal surfaces of Spartina patens high marshes in southern Maine, {USA}, proved to be important habitat for resident mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus production. Manipulations of fish movement onto high marsh surfaces revealed similar growth rates and production among fish that were (1) restricted to pools, (2) had access to known areas of marsh surface, or (3) had free access to the entire marsh. Smaller scale manipulations with marked fish revealed that males with access to the marsh surface accumulated significantly more biomass, often exhibited higher growth rates, and had a 1.6\&\#xd7; greater production rate than males restricted to pools. Female production was only slightly higher for fish that could access the marsh compared to fish restricted to pools. While both pools and marsh surface appeared to support fish production, habitat partitioning also existed between sexes of mummichogs; males may rely more on the marsh surface for food while females rely more on pools. Growth and production of mummichogs in pools on the high marsh surface was lower than values reported from more southern, low marsh dominated systems. This was attributed to differences in (1) abiotic factors of salt marsh pools (this study) and tidal creeks and channels (other studies), (2) climate, and (3) tidal inundation and access time to the marsh surface. Fish production on the surface of Gulf of Maine high marsh ecosystems was equivalent to production in adjacent tidal creeks and channels. Thus, the high marsh surface proved to be an important habitat for supporting fish production in this region.},

The resultant water-logging may create anoxic conditions, eventually stimulating production and emission of methane, the most important greenhouse gas next to carbon dioxide. We examined the upper layer (similar to 30 cm) of Ljubljana marsh soil for microbial processes that would predominate in water-saturated conditions, focusing on the potential for iron reduction, carbon mineralization ({CO}(2) and {CH}(4) production), and methane emission. Methane emission from water-saturated microcosms was near minimum detectable levels even after extended periods of flooding ({\textgreater} 5 months). Methane production in anoxic soil slurries started only after a lag period of 84 d at 15 degrees C and a minimum of 7 d at 37 degrees C, the optimum temperature for methanogenesis. This lag was inversely related to iron reduction, which suggested that iron reduction out-competed methanogenesis for electron donors, such as H(2) and acetate. Methane production was observed only in samples incubated at 14-38 degrees C. At the beginning of methanogenesis, acetoclastic methanogenesis dominated. In accordance with the preferred substrate, most (91\%) {mcrA} (encoding the methyl coenzyme-M reductase, a key gene in methanogenesis) clone sequences could be affiliated to the acetoclastic genus Methanosarcina. No methanogens were detected in the original soil. However, a diverse community of iron-reducing Geobacteraceae was found. Our results suggest that methane emission can remain transient and low if water-table fluctuations allow re-oxidation of ferrous iron, sustaining iron reduction as the most important process in terminal carbon mineralization.},

	abstract = {To counteract extensive wetland loss a series of diversion projects have been implemented to introduce freshwater and sediment from the Mississippi River into Louisiana coastal wetlands. To keep pace with increases in water level due to subsidence Louisiana coastal marshes must vertically accrete through the accumulation of both organic matter and mineral sediment. The impact of Mississippi River freshwater diversion on enhancing vertical marsh accretion (mineral and organic matter accumulation) was examined in Breton Sound estuary, a coastal wetland experiencing marsh deterioration as result of subsidence and salt water intrusion. Using 137Cs dating and artificial marker horizons, increases in the rate of vertical marsh accretion were measured at marsh sites along a spatial gradient which has been receiving diverted water from the Mississippi River (Caernarvon diversion) since 1991. Vertical accretion and accumulation of mineral sediment organic matter and nutrients in the marsh soil profile, increased at marsh sites receiving freshwater and sediment input. Iron and manganese content of the marsh surface sediment were shown to be an excellent signature of riverine sediment deposition. Soil extractable phosphorus was higher and extractable sodium was lower at sites nearest freshwater and sediment input. Results demonstrated that freshwater diversion through sediment input and lowering of salinity will enhance marsh accretion and stability, slowing or reversing the rate of wetland loss.},

Settlement can be sub-divided into compression due to consolidation and deformation attributed to biodegradation. Results of an extensive geotechnical laboratory evaluation including compaction characteristics, shear strength parameters, coefficient of consolidation, compression index, swell index and coefficient of secondary consolidation were used to predict the consolidation settlement of biosolids in road embankments. Other relevant parameters for biodegradation settlement prediction, such as organic content, {pH} and electrical conductivity of the biosolids were also determined. The biodegradation induced settlement of a road embankment built with aged biosolids was subsequently analyzed by applying an analytical method used previously for municipal solid waste landfills. The adopted model shows that the rate of biodegradation settlement reduces with the reduction in {pH} values of biosolids. The model also suggests that the time taken for full process of biodegradation decreases dramatically with {pH} value of the biosolids between 0 and 6 and then increases exponentially with {pH} value of the biosolids between 8 and 14. A framework has been developed to predict the total settlement of wastewater biosolids in road embankments for end-users.},

Fourteen different multiyear field combinations of nutrient amendments to salt marshes were made to determine the relationship between soil strength and various nitrogen, phosphorus, and nitrogen+phosphorus loadings. There was a proportional decline in soil strength that reached 35\% in the 60- to 100-cm soil layer at the highest loadings and did not level off. These loading rates are equivalent to those in the flow path of the Caernarvon river diversion, a major wetland restoration project near New Orleans; 12\% of the wetlands in the flow path were converted to open water in 2005. The increased nutrient loading from the Mississippi River watershed this century has also driven the formation of the low oxygen zone (the “Dead Zone”) that forms off the Louisiana–Texas shelf each summer. These results suggest that improving water quality in the watershed will aid the restoration of both offshore waters and coastal wetland ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Over 25\% of Mississippi delta ({MRDP}) wetlands were lost over the past century. There is currently a major effort to restore the {MRDP} focused on a 50-year time horizon, a period during which the energy system and climate will change dramatically. I modeled hydraulic dredging to sustain marsh from 2016-2066 and 2016-2100 under a range of scenarios for sea level rise, energy price, and management regimes. A marsh elevation model was calibrated to data from {MRDP} marshes. I developed a model to simulate dredging costs based on the price of crude oil and a project efficiency factor. Crude oil prices were projected using forecasts from global energy models. The costs to sustain marsh between 2016 and 2100 changed from \$128,000 ha-1 in the no change scenario to {\textasciitilde}\$1,010,000 ha-1 in the worst-case scenario in sea level rise and energy price, an {\textasciitilde}8-fold increase. Increasing suspended sediment load raised created marsh lifespan and decreased long term dredging costs. Created marsh lifespan changed nonlinearly with dredging fill elevation and suspended sediment level. Costs and benefits of marsh creation can be optimized by adjusting dredging fill elevations based on the local sediment regime. Regardless of management scenario, sustaining the {MRDP} with hydraulic dredging suffered declining returns on investment due to the convergence of energy and climate. Marsh creation will likely become unaffordable in the mid to late 21st century, especially if river sediment diversions are not constructed before 2030. Planners must take into consideration coupled energy and climate scenarios for long-term risk assessments and adjust restoration goals accordingly.},

The current emphasis on restoring habitat structure—without explicitly considering food webs—has been less successful than hoped in terms of enhancing the status of targeted species and often overlooks important constraints on ecologically effective restoration. We identify three priority food web-related issues that potentially impede successful river restoration: uncertainty about habitat carrying capacity, proliferation of chemicals and contaminants, and emergence of hybrid food webs containing a mixture of native and invasive species. Additionally, there is the need to place these food web considerations in a broad temporal and spatial framework by understanding the consequences of altered nutrient, organic matter (energy), water, and thermal sources and flows, reconnecting critical habitats and their food webs, and restoring for changing environments. As an illustration, we discuss how the Columbia River Basin, site of one of the largest aquatic/riparian restoration programs in the United States, would benefit from implementing a food web perspective. A food web perspective for the Columbia River would complement ongoing approaches and enhance the ability to meet the vision and legal obligations of the {US} Endangered Species Act, the Northwest Power Act (Fish and Wildlife Program), and federal treaties with Northwest Indian Tribes while meeting fundamental needs for improved river management.},

The continuing crisis of youth restiveness and resistance is traceable to this larger development issue.

Methane is produced in the anaerobic zones of submerged soils by methanogens and is oxidised into {CO}2 by methanotrophs in the aerobic zones of wetland soils and in upland soils. Methanogens and methanotrophs are ubiquitous in soils where they remain viable under unfavourable conditions. Methane transfer from the soil to the atmosphere occurs mostly through the aerenchyma of aquatic plants, but also by diffusion and as bubbles escaping from wetland soils. Methane sources are mainly wetlands. However 60 to more than 90 \% of {CH}4 produced in the anaerobic zones of wetlands is reoxidised in their aerobic zones (rhizosphere and oxidised soil-water interface). Methane consumption occurs in most soils and exhibits a broad range of values. Highest consumption rates or potentials are observed in soils where methanogenesis is or has been effective and where {CH}4 concentration is or has been much higher than in the atmosphere (ricefields, swamps, landfills, etc.). Aerobic soils consume atmospheric {CH}4 but their activities are very low and the micro-organisms involved are largely unknown. Methane emissions by cultivated or natural wetlands are expressed in mg {CH}4·m–2·h–1 with a median lower than 10 mg {CH}4·m–2·h–1. Methanotrophy in wetlands is most often expressed with the same unit. Methane oxidation by aerobic upland soils is rarely higher than 0.1 mg {CH}4·m–2·h–1. Forest soils are the most active, followed by grasslands and cultivated soils. Factors that favour {CH}4 emission from cultivated wetlands are mostly submersion and organic matter addition. Intermittent drainage and utilisation of the sulphate forms of N-fertilisers reduce {CH}4 emission. Methane oxidation potential of upland soils is reduced by cultivation, especially by ammonium N-fertiliser application.},

	abstract = {Abstract Southern Louisiana is characterized by low-lying topography and an extensive network of sounds, bays, marshes, lakes, rivers, and inlets that permit widespread inundation during hurricanes. A basin- to channel-scale implementation of the Advanced Circulation ({ADCIRC}) unstructured grid hydrodynamic model has been developed that accurately simulates hurricane storm surge, tides, and river flow in this complex region. This is accomplished by defining a domain and computational resolution appropriate for the relevant processes, specifying realistic boundary conditions, and implementing accurate, robust, and highly parallel unstructured grid numerical algorithms. The model domain incorporates the western North Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea so that interactions between basins and the shelf are explicitly modeled and the boundary condition specification of tidal and hurricane processes can be readily defined at the deep water open boundary. The unstructured grid enables highly refined resolution of the complex overland region for modeling localized scales of flow while minimizing computational cost. Kinematic data assimilative or validated dynamic-modeled wind fields provide the hurricane wind and pressure field forcing. Wind fields are modified to incorporate directional boundary layer changes due to overland increases in surface roughness, reduction in effective land roughness due to inundation, and sheltering due to forested canopies. Validation of the model is achieved through hindcasts of Hurricanes Betsy and Andrew. A model skill assessment indicates that the computed peak storm surge height has a mean absolute error of 0.30 m.},

Consequently, an accurate method to quantify the effect of wetlands on coastal surge levels is required. The degree to which wetlands attenuate surge is the subject of debate and difficult to assess. The potential of wetlands to reduce storm surge has typically been expressed as a constant attenuation rate, but the relationship is much more complex. A numerical storm surge model was applied to assess the sensitivity of surge response to specified wetland loss. Results suggest that wetlands do have the potential to reduce surges but the magnitude of attenuation is dependent on the surrounding coastal landscape and the strength and duration of the storm forcing. Numerical models that simulate the relevant physical processes can provide valuable information on how to best integrate wetlands into coastal protection plans. However, while the model applied for this study has displayed skill in estimating surges over wetlands, the formulations are missing key processes and model advancements are necessary.},

	abstract = {Background Tidal marshes will be threatened by increasing rates of sea-level rise ({SLR}) over the next century. Managers seek guidance on whether existing and restored marshes will be resilient under a range of potential future conditions, and on prioritizing marsh restoration and conservation activities. Methodology Building upon established models, we developed a hybrid approach that involves a mechanistic treatment of marsh accretion dynamics and incorporates spatial variation at a scale relevant for conservation and restoration decision-making. We applied this model to San Francisco Bay, using best-available elevation data and estimates of sediment supply and organic matter accumulation developed for 15 Bay subregions. Accretion models were run over 100 years for 70 combinations of starting elevation, mineral sediment, organic matter, and {SLR} assumptions. Results were applied spatially to evaluate eight Bay-wide climate change scenarios. Principal Findings Model results indicated that under a high rate of {SLR} (1.65 m/century), short-term restoration of diked subtidal baylands to mid marsh elevations (−0.2 m {MHHW}) could be achieved over the next century with sediment concentrations greater than 200 mg/L. However, suspended sediment concentrations greater than 300 mg/L would be required for 100-year mid marsh sustainability (i.e., no elevation loss). Organic matter accumulation had minimal impacts on this threshold. Bay-wide projections of marsh habitat area varied substantially, depending primarily on {SLR} and sediment assumptions. Across all scenarios, however, the model projected a shift in the mix of intertidal habitats, with a loss of high marsh and gains in low marsh and mudflats. Conclusions/Significance Results suggest a bleak prognosis for long-term natural tidal marsh sustainability under a high-{SLR} scenario. To minimize marsh loss, we recommend conserving adjacent uplands for marsh migration, redistributing dredged sediment to raise elevations, and concentrating restoration efforts in sediment-rich areas. To assist land managers, we developed a web-based decision support tool (www.prbo.org/sfbayslr).},

	abstract = {More than 2 y have passed since the {BP}–Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, yet we still have little understanding of its ecological impacts. Examining effects of this oil spill will generate much-needed insight into how shoreline habitats and the valuable ecological services they provide (e.g., shoreline protection) are affected by and recover from large-scale disturbance. Here we report on not only rapid salt-marsh recovery (high resilience) but also permanent marsh area loss after the {BP}–Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Field observations, experimental manipulations, and wave-propagation modeling reveal that (i) oil coverage was primarily concentrated on the seaward edge of marshes; (ii) there were thresholds of oil coverage that were associated with severity of salt-marsh damage, with heavy oiling leading to plant mortality; (iii) oil-driven plant death on the edges of these marshes more than doubled rates of shoreline erosion, further driving marsh platform loss that is likely to be permanent; and (iv) after 18 mo, marsh grasses have largely recovered into previously oiled, noneroded areas, and the elevated shoreline retreat rates observed at oiled sites have decreased to levels at reference marsh sites. This paper highlights that heavy oil coverage on the shorelines of Louisiana marshes, already experiencing elevated retreat because of intense human activities, induced a geomorphic feedback that amplified this erosion and thereby set limits to the recovery of otherwise resilient vegetation. It thus warns of the enhanced vulnerability of already degraded marshes to heavy oil coverage and provides a clear example of how multiple human-induced stressors can interact to hasten ecosystem decline.},

The adoption of the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance in Ramsar, Iran in 1971 committed the {UK} to conserve and sustainably use intertidal mudflats and saltmarshes for the benefit of present and future generations. Through consideration of their importance and value, current status, the characteristics, causes and consequences of their loss, and the associated responses to loss, this paper reviews the {UK} progress towards the conservation and sustainable use of intertidal mudflats and saltmarshes. Uncertainties in their current status and trends make it difficult to assess the overall net change in extent across the {UK}. However, it is apparent that losses due to erosion continue to exceed gains from intertidal mudflat and saltmarsh reparation ({IMSR}) schemes in south-east and southern England. {IMSR} schemes in the {UK} have been generally limited to relatively small-scale trials in comparison to elsewhere in Europe and in the {USA}. No research to date has unequivocally identified the causes of erosion. Regardless of the cause, the loss of intertidal mudflats and saltmarshes has adverse impacts on the provision of ecosystem services upon which humans and other species depend. The evidence presented in this paper suggests that alongside further science-based research, there is a need to develop a decision-making process capable of accommodating complexity, uncertainty and multiple diverse perspectives, through which more informed, timely decisions and more effective, concerted actions to conserve and sustainably use intertidal mudflats and saltmarshes can be taken.},

This study investigated the relationship between rate of radial oxygen loss ({ROL}), root porosity, Zn uptake and tolerance, Fe plaque formation in wetland plants. Methods A hydroponic experiment and a pot trial with Zn-contaminated soil were conducted to apply different Zn level treatments to various emergent wetland plants. Results Significant differences were found between plants in their root porosities, rates of {ROL}, Zn uptake and Zn tolerance indices in the hydroponic experiment, and concentrations of Fe and Mn on roots and in the rhizosphere in the pot trial. There were significant positive correlations between root porosities, {ROL} rates, Zn tolerance, Zn, Fe and Mn concentrations on roots and in the rhizosphere. Wetland plants with higher root porosities and {ROL} tended to have more Fe plaque, higher Zn concentrations on roots and in their rhizospheres, and were more tolerant of Zn toxicity. Conclusions Our results suggest that {ROL} and root porosity play very important roles in Fe plaque formation, Zn uptake and tolerance, and are useful criteria for selecting wetland plants for the phytoremediation of Zn-contaminated waters and soils/sediments.},

	abstract = {Although several recent studies point at the importance of seagrass roots for nutrient acquisition in oligotrophic tropical ecosystems, remarkably little is known about the root architecture of tropical seagrasses. The present study provides a detailed description of the root architecture of six seagrass species that were extracted from three sites differing in sediment type and nutrient availability (i.e., except for one species that was not present at one of the sites). Number of roots per node, order of root branching, length and diameter per root order, root hair density and length were determined and used to calculate a topological index for the different species and habitats. Root architecture differed strongly between species. The relatively long-lived and slowly-growing species Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides were characterised by short internodes with relatively few unbranched roots per node and a high root hair density. More fast growing species such as Cymodocea rotundata, Cymodocea serrulata and Syringodium isoetifolium had many roots per node, the majority of which were branched. Surprisingly, differences in sediment type and nutrient availability, as present between locations, had little effect on root architecture. We expect this to be due to a relatively homogeneous nutrient distribution at the small scale within water saturated sediments. Overall, all seagrass species had relatively simple branching (topological index \&gt; 0.7), comparable to angiosperms of the low temperate salt marsh. We speculate that relatively simple root architecture of plants in flooded systems reflects the need for a minimal path length for oxygen transport from shoots to roots.},

	abstract = {Land loss in the Mississippi River delta caused by subsidence and erosion has resulted in habitat loss and increased exposure of settled areas to storm surge risks. There is debate over the most cost-efficient and geomorphologically feasible projects to build land by river diversions, namely, whether a larger number of small, or a lesser number of large, engineered diversions provide the most efficient outcomes. This study uses an optimization framework to identify portfolios of diversions that are efficient for three general restoration objectives: maximize land built, minimize cost, and minimize water diverted. The framework links the following models: (1) a hydraulic water and sediment diversion model that, for a given structural design for a diversion, estimates the volume of water and sediment diverted; (2) a geomorphological land-building model that estimates the amount of land built over a time period, given the volume of water and sediment; and (3) a statistical model of investment cost as a function of diversion depth and width. An efficient portfolio is found by optimizing one objective subject to constraints on achievement of the other two; then by permuting those constraints, we find distinct portfolios that represent trade-offs among the objectives. Although the analysis explores generic relationships among size, cost, and land building (and thus does not consider specific project proposals or locations), the results demonstrate that large-scale land building ({\textgreater}200 km2) programs that operate over a time span of 50 years require deep diversions because of the enhanced efficiency of sand extraction per unit water. This conclusion applies whether or not there are significant scale economies or diseconomies associated with wider and deeper diversions.},

The turbulence intensity and the Reynolds stress are largest near the top of the layer. An advanced technique using particle image velocimetry is developed to measure the instantaneous two-dimensional and three-dimensional flow field. The measurements reveal that organized vortices are generated intermittently above the vegetation. A side view of the vortex shows an elliptical shape, and the part of the three-dimensional structure above the vegetation layer consists of a pair of vortices inclined downward toward the front. The period of the vortex generation is explained in terms of linear stability analysis of flows with an inflectional velocity profile. The wavy motion of flexible vegetation is induced by the movement of such organized vortices.},

	abstract = {Abstract The initial establishment and survival of a salt marsh is regulated by a variety of factors, including salinity, sediment type, elevation, nutrient levels, and wave climate. Despite the obvious importance of wave climate on the existence or nonexistence of wetlands along shorelines of water bodies, there are currently few methods for its evaluation at wetland locations. This study used an existing wind-wave hindcast method to estimate wave climate at sites with and without Spartina alterniflora along the shoreline in coastal Alabama. The sites with vegetation along the shoreline had lower wave levels than nearby sites without vegetation. Other sites with eroding stands of vegetation had wave levels intermediate between the no-vegetation and vegetation sites. The upper limit of wave energy for (noneroding) salt marsh existence was a median significant wave height of about H = 0.1 meter and a corresponding 80 percentile (less than this level 80\% of the time) significant wave height of H = 0.2 meter. Sites with less wave energy had vegetation along the shoreline. The results indicate that wave height frequency distribution based on wind-wave modeling hindcasts is an appropriate methodology for wave climate evaluation at wetland sites. The results can be used to minimize the size of breakwaters used in constructed wetlands.},

	abstract = {This review examines the published work on bareroot and container stocktypes in forest restoration programs. The objective was to define overall trends between these two stocktypes and describe what they mean in terms of available information on their nursery and field performance. Stock quality assessments show bareroot seedlings have larger shoot systems because they are typically grown at lower densities, and in many instances longer timeframes, than container seedlings. Container systems typically produce seedlings having a lower shoot to root ratio and a greater root growth potential, conferring greater drought avoidance potential. However, assessments of stress resistance and nutrition found no conclusive evidence that either stocktype has a performance advantage, other than the container plug acting as a source of water and nutrient storage available for outplanting performance. Bareroot seedlings are more sensitive to handling practices of lifting, storage, transport and planting and these practices can negatively affect their performance. Container seedlings can have a higher level of field survival which is related, in part, to their greater drought avoidance potential, thereby overcoming planting stress. Bareroot and container seedlings have comparable survival rates on sites with minimal planting stress. Once seedlings are established, bareroot and container seedlings can have comparable field performance. In many instances where plant competition is the main limiting site variable, larger sized bareroot and container stocktypes have the best chance for successful stand establishment. The lack of a natural root form and root distribution for both stocktypes is a debated mechanical stability issue, though risks of windthrow have not been consistently demonstrated for either stocktype.},

	abstract = {Among the solutions being proposed for reversing wetland loss in the Mississippi River Delta are the creation of diversions to reintroduce suspended sediment carried in the river. In areas of rapid relative sea-level rise, as in the Mississippi Delta, it is generally accepted that a supply of sediment in flood water and mineral sedimentation are critical to sustaining wetlands. But plans to create diversions have raised questions about the collateral effects of nutrients carried in the Mississippi River, effects that may contravene the benefits of sediment. This review finds the balance of empirical and theoretical evidence supports that nutrients benefit above- and belowground plant production and that fresh water and sediment diversions can be effective and beneficial for restoring wetlands in the Delta, especially if designed to maximize sediment inputs. The input of sediment, nutrients, and fresh water will change the community composition of some wetlands and their biogeochemical processes. Most of the nitrogen input should be assimilated or denitrified. Labile organic matter is likely to degrade more quickly, but labile organic matter does not add ‘new’ soil volume and its speed of decay is of little consequence. Additional research is needed before we fully understand the consequences of nutrients on the preservation of organic matter in sediment, but building on what is known of the activities of lignin-degrading fungi and their enzymes, it is likely that refractory organic matter should increase and contribute positively to sediment accretion. This is supported by long-term studies of sediment accretion in a New England salt marsh with peat sediment, and in a mineral-dominated southeastern salt marsh, that show elevations in fertilized plots gained as much or more than in reference plots.},

Two wetland species,Spartina alterniflora Loisel. {andSagittaria} lancifolia L., were used to test their response to the following substrate treatments: 100\% marsh sediment, 100\% red mud, a mixture of 50\% marsh sediment and 50\% red mud, a mixture of 50\% red mud and 50\% compost, and neutralized red mud. Each substrate treatment received two fertilization levels, fertilized (N−P−K) and unfertilized. Red mud could support the growth of the salt marsh species,Spartina alterniflora, but not the fresh marsh species.Sagittaria lancifolia. The high Na content and salinity of red mud, even when mixed with marsh sediment or compost, appeared to be the primary cause for the high mortality {ofSagittaria} in these substrates. Fertilization did not reduce the stress response {ofSagittaria} to red mud, but significantly increased the growth {ofSpartina}. Red mud is low in available N and P and required fertilizer or organic matter (e.g., compost) addition to increase fertility. In experiments with both fresh and salt marsh sediments, the concentrations of soluble heavy metals, with the exception of Mn, were not significantly greater for red mud than for marsh sediment. Thus, the release of heavy metals from red mud over the short-term may not pose an environmental concern. However, the mobilization of heavy metals over the long-term and the influence of plants in accumulating metals requires further investigation.},

Here we manipulated factorial combinations of {CO}2 concentration (two levels), N availability (two levels) and relative sea level (six levels) using in situ mesocosms containing a tidal marsh community composed of a sedge, Schoenoplectus americanus, and a grass, Spartina patens. Our objective is to determine, if elevated {CO}2 and N alter the growth and persistence of these plants in coastal ecosystems facing rising sea levels. After two growing seasons, we found that N addition enhanced plant growth particularly at sea levels where plants were most stressed by flooding (114\% stimulation in the + 10 cm treatment), and N effects were generally larger in combination with elevated {CO}2 (288\% stimulation). N fertilization shifted the optimal productivity of S. patens to a higher sea level, but did not confer S. patens an enhanced ability to tolerate sea level rise. S. americanus responded strongly to N only in the higher sea level treatments that excluded S. patens. Interestingly, addition of N, which has been suggested to accelerate marsh loss, may afford some marsh plants, such as the widespread sedge, S. americanus, the enhanced ability to tolerate inundation. However, if chronic N pollution reduces the availability of propagules of S. americanus or other flood-tolerant species on the landscape scale, this shift in species dominance could render tidal marshes more susceptible to marsh collapse.},

	abstract = {In Mediterranean environments, gully erosion is responsible for large soil losses. It has since long been recognized that slopes under vegetation are much more resistant to soil erosion processes compared to bare soils and improve slope stability. Planting or preserving vegetation in areas vulnerable to erosion is therefore considered to be a very effective soil erosion control measure. Re-vegetation strategies for erosion control rely in most cases on the effects of the above-ground biomass in reducing water erosion rates, whereas the role of the below-ground biomass is often neglected or underestimated. While the above-ground biomass can temporally disappear in semi-arid environments, roots may still be present underground and play an important role in protecting the topsoil from being eroded. In order to evaluate the potential of plant species growing in Mediterranean environments to prevent shallow mass movements on gully or terrace walls, the root reinforcement effect of 25 typical Mediterranean matorral species (i.e. shrubs, grasses herbs, small trees) was assessed, using the simple perpendicular model of Wu et al. (Can Geotech J 16:19–33, 1979). As little information is available on Mediterranean plant root characteristics, root distribution data were collected in {SE}-Spain and root tensile strength tests were conducted in the laboratory. The power root tensile strength–root diameter relationships depend on plant species. The results show that the shrubs Salsola genistoides Juss. Ex Poir. and Atriplex halimus L. have the strongest roots, followed by the grass Brachypodium retusum (Pers.) Beauv. The shrubs Nerium oleander L. and the grass Avenula bromoides (Gouan) H. Scholz have the weakest roots in tension. Root area ratio for the 0–0.1 m topsoil ranges from 0.08\% for the grass Piptatherum miliaceum (L.) Coss to 0.8\% for the tree Tamarix canariensis Willd. The rush Juncus acutus L. provides the maximum soil reinforcement to the topsoil by its roots (i.e. 304 {kPa}). Grasses also increase soil shear strength significantly (up to 244 {kPa} in the 0–0.1 m topsoil for Brachypodium retusum (Pers.) Beauv.). The shrubs Retama sphaerocarpa (L.) Boiss. and Anthyllis cytisoides L. are increasing soil shear strength to a large extent as well (up to 134 and 160 {kPa} respectively in the 0–0.10 m topsoil). Whereas grasses and the rush Juncus acutus L. increase soil shear strength in the topsoil (0–0.10 m) to a large extent, the shrubs Anthyllis cytisoides (L.), Retama sphaerocarpa (L.) Boiss., Salsola genistoides Juss. Ex Poir. and Atriplex halimus L. strongly reinforce the soil to a greater depth (0–0.5 m). As other studies reported that Wu’s model overestimates root cohesion values, reported root cohesion values in this study are maximum values. Nevertheless, the calculated cohesion values are used to rank species according to their potential to reinforce the soil.},

About half the global wetland area has been lost, but an international treaty (the 1971 Ramsar Convention) has helped 144 nations protect the most significant remaining wetlands. Because most nations lack wetland inventories, changes in the quantity and quality of the world's wetlands cannot be tracked adequately. Despite the likelihood that remaining wetlands occupy less than 9\% of the earth's land area, they contribute more to annually renewable ecosystem services than their small area implies. Biodiversity support, water quality improvement, flood abatement, and carbon sequestration are key functions that are impaired when wetlands are lost or degraded. Restoration techniques are improving, although the recovery of lost biodiversity is challenged by invasive species, which thrive under disturbance and displace natives. Not all damages to wetlands are reversible, but it is not always clear how much can be retained through restoration.

	abstract = {* 1 We compared the root systems of seven halophytic species that occur at different elevations on a salt marsh, in order to (i) test the hypothesis that variations in root system architecture reflect adaptation to inundation frequency or nitrogen limitation, and (ii) verify the theoretically predicted relationships between root diameter, link magnitude and root topology. Diameters and lengths of individual laterals were determined along root axes, and branching patterns were quantified by calculating a topological index ({TI}).
* 2 Chenopodiaceae (annual dicots) showed that with increasing elevation, the branch density and length of individual first-order laterals tended to increase, so that the relative length of the main axes decreased. Root branching of the Chenopodiaceae at lower elevations was herringbone-like, whereas species from higher elevations had smaller {TIs} because their branching patterns were more complex.
* 3 The Gramineae, too, showed a tendency to increased length of individual laterals with increasing elevation. However, {TI} was not related to elevation, did not indicate a herringbone structure for all species, and was within the same range of that of the Chenopodiaceae.
* 4 As root topology of the Chenopodiaceae is related to elevation, but that of the grasses is not, topology is not necessarily an important adaptive trait in all plant families that inhabit the salt marsh. Short first- and second-order laterals may represent a more general architectural adaptation to frequent inundation, with longer first-order laterals being favourable to competition for nutrients.
* 5 Diameters at the root base tended to decrease if root branching was herringbone-like ({TI} close to 1). Roots of first-order laterals were approximately one-third of the diameter of the main axes; second-order laterals were approximately half the diameter of the first-order laterals. These ratios illustrate the value of using the developmental segment-ordering system in describing roots. The theoretically predicted relationship between root diameter and link magnitude was not present within individual orders of roots, whereas diameter did slowly increase with magnitude when combining different root orders.
* 6 In the absence of a clear relationship between root diameter and link magnitude, the predicted high carbon costs associated with herringbone root systems disappear, whereas the advantage of minimized inter-root competition remains. Consequently, herringbone root systems will be most efficient in terms of nutrients gained per carbon invested. However, dichotomous root systems offer a greater potential for exploring the soil, which contributes to the potential competitiveness of plants growing in nutrient limited habitats.},

	abstract = {Coastal subsidence causes sea-level rise, shoreline erosion and wetland loss, which poses a threat to coastal populations. This is especially evident in the Mississippi Delta in the southern United States, which was devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The loss of protective wetlands is considered a critical factor in the extensive flood damage. The causes of subsidence in coastal Louisiana, attributed to factors as diverse as shallow compaction and deep crustal processes, remain controversial. Current estimates of subsidence rates vary by several orders of magnitude. Here, we use a series of radiocarbon-dated sediment cores from the Mississippi Delta to analyse late Holocene deposits and assess compaction rates. We find that millennial-scale compaction rates primarily associated with peat can reach 5 mm per year, values that exceed recent model predictions. Locally and on timescales of decades to centuries, rates are likely to be 10 mm or more per year. We conclude that compaction of Holocene strata contributes significantly to the exceptionally high rates of relative sea-level rise and coastal wetland loss in the Mississippi Delta, and is likely to cause subsidence in other organic-rich and often densely populated coastal plains.},

	abstract = {Salt marsh ecosystems are maintained by the dominant macrophytes that regulate the elevation of their habitat within a narrow portion of the intertidal zone by accumulating organic matter and trapping inorganic sediment. The long-term stability of these ecosystems is explained by interactions among sea level, land elevation, primary production, and sediment accretion that regulate the elevation of the sediment surface toward an equilibrium with mean sea level. We show here in a salt marsh that this equilibrium is adjusted upward by increased production of the salt marsh macrophyte Spartina alterniflora and downward by an increasing rate of relative sea-level rise ({RSLR}). Adjustments in marsh surface elevation are slow in comparison to interannual anomalies and long-period cycles of sea level, and this lag in sediment elevation results in significant variation in annual primary productivity. We describe a theoretical model that predicts that the system will be stable against changes in relative mean sea level when surface elevation is greater than what is optimal for primary production. When surface elevation is less than optimal, the system will be unstable. The model predicts that there is an optimal rate of {RSLR} at which the equilibrium elevation and depth of tidal flooding will be optimal for plant growth. However, the optimal rate of {RSLR} also represents an upper limit because at higher rates of {RSLR} the plant community cannot sustain an elevation that is within its range of tolerance. For estuaries with high sediment loading, such as those on the southeast coast of the United States, the limiting rate of {RSLR} was predicted to be at most 1.2 cm/yr, which is 3.5 times greater than the current, long-term rate of {RSLR}.},

	abstract = {Over the past few centuries, 25\% of the deltaic wetlands associated with the Mississippi Delta have been lost to the ocean. Plans to protect and restore the coast call for diversions of the Mississippi River, and its associated sediment, to sustain and build new land. However, the sediment load of the Mississippi River has been reduced by 50\% through dam construction in the Mississippi Basin, which could affect the effectiveness of diversion plans. Here we calculate the amount of sediment stored on the delta plain for the past 12,000 years, and find that mean storage rates necessary to construct the flood plain and delta over this period exceed modern Mississippi River sediment loads. We estimate that, in the absence of sediment input, an additional 10,000–13,500 km2 will be submerged by the year 2100 owing to subsidence and sea-level rise. Sustaining existing delta surface area would require 18–24 billion tons of sediment, which is significantly more than can be drawn from the Mississippi River in its current state. We conclude that significant drowning is inevitable, even if sediment loads are restored, because sea level is now rising at least three times faster than during delta-plain construction.},

Index, drying, compaction, shear strength and consolidation tests were conducted on the material at different states of biodegradation. The organic content and specific gravity of solids were found to be inversely related, with typical organic contents of 50–70\% and specific gravity of solids values of 1.55–1.80. The density of the compacted material was low in comparison with mineral soils. Standard Proctor compaction yielded a maximum dry density of 0.56 tonne/m3 at 85\% water content. Laboratory vane-shear and triaxial compression tests indicated that, below about 180\% water content, the shear strength of the sludge material increased exponentially with reducing water content. Consolidated-undrained triaxial compression tests on the pasteurised sludge material indicated an effective angle of shearing resistance of 32° for the moderately degraded material and 37° for the strongly degraded material. Biogas was produced at rates of up to 0.33 L/day/kg slurry due to ongoing biodegradation and the resulting pore pressure response must be taken into account in any stress analysis. Consolidation tests using the hydraulic consolidation cell, oedometer and triaxial apparatus indicated that the sludge material was highly compressible although practically impermeable, for example the coefficient of permeability for the moderately degraded slurry was of the order of 10−9m/s. However, creep deformation was significant with typical coefficient of secondary compression values of 0.02–0.08 for the compacted material. A more free-draining material was produced at higher states of biodegradation.},

	abstract = {Abstract A growth experiment with native plants in pots exposed to natural environmental conditions evaluates the use of sewage sludge as a soil amendment in restoration of a southern California salt marsh. Sludge containing desirable organic matter but also undesirable heavy metal contaminants was mixed with a readily available matrix soil to reduce metal concentrations to levels below legal limits for land applications of sludge. Soil nutrient analysis revealed expected increases in total nitrogen and total phosphorus content with increasing sludge concentration. Soil metals analysis, however, revealed decreases in metal content with increased sludge concentration, a trend evidently caused by higher than expected metal content in the matrix soil. Five artificial soil mixtures ranging from 0 to 70\% sludge were accompanied by natural wetland soil controls. Pots containing these soils were placed into a natural salt marsh. The pots were then planted with two native salt marsh plant species, Salicornia virginica and Frankenia grandifolia. Aboveground biomass was harvested after 12 months. Plant growth displayed no obvious change with increasing sludge concentration. Over the concentration ranges used, increased nutrient content did not stimulate plant growth and increased metal content did not inhibit plant growth. Plants grew better in natural wetland soil than in artificial soil mixtures, a trend probably caused by the substantially finer texture and higher organic content of natural soil. All sludge treatments differed more from the natural soil than from each other, implying that within the ranges examined, soil texture and organic content exerted more influence on plant growth than did metal or nutrient concentration. These results suggest that incorporating this sewage sludge in the soil of the restored salt marsh will neither benefit nor harm the plants that will live there and that greatest plant growth will be achieved by mixing the sludge with a fine-grained matrix soil.},

The values generally agreed within a factor of 3 or less with those developed with the same methods applied to other data and to those developed with other effects-based methods. The incidence of adverse effects was quantified within each of the three concentration ranges as the number of cases in which effects were observed divided by the total number of observations. The incidence of effects increased markedly with increasing concentrations of all of the individual {PAHs}, the three classes of {PAHs}, and most of the trace metals. Relatively poor relationships were observed between the incidence of effects and the concentrations of mercury, nickel, total {PCB}, total {DDT} and p,p′-{DDE}. Based upon this evaluation, the approach provided reliable guidelines for use in sediment quality assessments. This method is being used as a basis for developing National sediment quality guidelines for Canada and informal, sediment quality guidelines for Florida.},

	abstract = {Abstract Vegetation as multiple stems in various configurations or an isolated stem profoundly alters turbulent flows. Past research has shown that these alterations influence sediment transport and stream morphology, but entail complex interactions and feedbacks between flow, vegetation, and sediment processes that involve many parameters. These interactions are examined here for a variety of macrophyte patterns and scales in riverine environments. Flow Reynolds number, canopy density, and submergence ratio are just a few of the key parameters that influence the spatial variability of the flow, momentum transfer, vortex shedding and dissipation, and instantaneous stresses that are known to affect sediment and morphological processes in rivers. Knowledge gaps, though, still remain. A taxonomy that classifies vegetated flows as dense, sparse, or isolated on the basis of threshold parameters like the ratio of stem diameter to stem spacing would be useful for comparing studies among researchers and predicting likely morphological pathways. More research is needed to quantify thresholds and empirical relationships for flow–vegetation–sediment interactions so that aquatic macrophyte plantings can be used more effectively in water resource management. Field measurements of plant, canopy, and plant patch characteristics for these macrophytes would also be desirable.},

About half the global wetland area has been lost, but an international treaty (the 1971 Ramsar Convention) has helped 144 nations protect the most significant remaining wetlands. Because most nations lack wetland inventories, changes in the quantity and quality of the world's wetlands cannot be tracked adequately. Despite the likelihood that remaining wetlands occupy less than 9\% of the earth's land area, they contribute more to annually renewable ecosystem services than their small area implies. Biodiversity support, water quality improvement, flood abatement, and carbon sequestration are key functions that are impaired when wetlands are lost or degraded. Restoration techniques are improving, although the recovery of lost biodiversity is challenged by invasive species, which thrive under disturbance and displace natives. Not all damages to wetlands are reversible, but it is not always clear how much can be retained through restoration. Hence, we recommend adaptive approaches in which alternative techniques are tested at large scales in actual restoration sites.},

The study was carried out using cultivated organic soils from two locations in Sweden: Örke, a typical cultivated fen peat with low {pH} and high organic matter content and Majnegården, a more uncommon fen peat type with high {pH} and low organic matter content. Even though carbon and nitrogen contents differ greatly between the sites, carbon and nitrogen density are quite similar. A drilling method with minimal soil disturbance was used to collect 12 undisturbed soil monoliths (50 cm high, Ø29.5 cm) per site. They were sown with ryegrass (Lolium perenne) after the original vegetation was removed. The lysimeter design allowed the introduction of water at depth so as to maintain a constant water table at either 40 cm or 80 cm below the soil surface. {CO}2, {CH}4 and N2O emissions from the lysimeters were measured weekly and complemented with incubation experiments with small undisturbed soil cores subjected to different tensions (5, 40, 80 and 600 cm water column). {CO}2 emissions were greater from the treatment with the high water table level (40 cm) compared with the low level (80 cm). N2O emissions peaked in springtime and {CH}4 emissions were very low or negative. Estimated {GHG} emissions during one year were between 2.70 and 3.55 kg {CO}2 equivalents m−2. The results from the incubation experiment were in agreement with emissions results from the lysimeter experiments. We attribute the observed differences in {GHG} emissions between the soils to the contrasting dry matter liability and soil physical properties. The properties of the different soil layers will determine the effect of water table regulation. Lowering the water table without exposing new layers with easily decomposable material would have a limited effect on emission rates.},

	abstract = {Summary
The Mississippi is the largest riverine system in North America and one of the most engineered rivers in the world. The challenges of studying the Mississippi River are due to its complex sediment–water dynamics and the multi (and often competing) uses for its resources. Flood control and navigation are primary factors that control how the river is managed. A third factor is the use of river resources, namely water and sediment, for nourishing the degrading coastal wetlands of the states of Louisiana and Mississippi. As such, these factors must be fully considered and coordinated while investigating and developing techniques to harness the sediment resources of the River for coastal restoration. This paper presents a detailed suspended sediment budget analysis for the lowermost Mississippi and Atchafalaya River systems for the flood years of 2008, 2009, and 2010. Data were derived mainly from Federal and State of Louisiana measurements of water discharge and suspended sediment load at (1) monitoring stations along the river channel and (2) boat-based measurements made during specific project studies at natural passes and man-made channel diversions. The present study was focused on flood years 2008–2010 to (1) minimize the influence on the budgets of a historical decline in sediment loads carried by the river as observed by previous investigators and (2) take advantage of recent improvements in the monitoring network. The results show that both the Mississippi and Atchafalaya distributary pathways were efficient at sequestering suspended sediments, particularly the larger (sand) size fraction. Approximately 44\% of the total Mississippi + Red River suspended load (80\% of the sand) reaching Old River Control structures split between the distributaries was sequestered upstream of the Gulf of Mexico by overbank storage and channel bed aggradation. Increases in bed aggradation in the Mississippi distributary are linked to a loss of stream power associated with man-made and natural exits upstream of the Gulf of Mexico. This further decreased the water and suspended sediment load reaching the deep water Gulf distributary exits in {FY}08–10 to 46\% (water), 19\% (total suspended load), and 1.4\% (suspended sand). These patterns of sediment storage and delivery have major implications for channel dredging and river sediment diversions planned for Louisiana coastal restoration.},

Approximately one million gallons per day (3,785 m−3 day−1) are discharged into the 1470 ha wetland, with average total nitrogen and phosphorus loading rates of 1.15 g N m−2 yr−1 and 0.31 g P m−2 yr−1, respectively. Vegetation and water quality of this wetland, along with a reference wetland, were monitored. Study sites were dominated by bald cypress and water tupelo, and species composition did not change significantly during the time of monitoring. Mean litterfall was higher near the effluent discharge point compared to sites located further away or the reference site. Mean stem growth was lower at the site furthest from the discharge point compared to the other sites. Nutrient concentrations measured at the site where water exits the assimilation area and at the reference site were not significantly different. Removal efficiencies for total nitrogen and phosphorus are typical of other forested wetlands receiving treated effluent in Louisiana, ranging between 65 and 90\%. These results demonstrate that this wetland assimilates nutrients to background concentrations even after 60 years of operation, stimulating productivity, and causing no measurable impacts to the wetland or to the river into which the water eventually flows.},

An analysis of the essence of the "oncogene position effect" from this standpoint shows that an integration, similar in its mechanism but differing in polarity, of the genome of other viruses with the cell genome should lead to the formation of a corresponding antiviral stable (life-long) immunity or also to the emergence of pseudoautoimmune disease of the type caused by "slow" viruses.},

In general, the bacterial communities of the natural wetland were more diverse than those of the constructed wetland.

	abstract = {The coastal morphology of Bangladesh influences the impact of natural hazards on the area. Especially, in the south–western area, natural hazards increase the vulnerability of the coastal dwellers and slow down the process of social and economic developments. There is a serious need for an effective disaster management plan to minimize the loss of lives and property. Unfortunately, the present cyclone warning signal is not only highly ineffective, but, sometimes also confusing. There is no comprehensive disaster management strategy. Some of the local {NGOs} in collaboration with government agencies undertake certain activities, but these too have been limited to mostly relief and rehabilitation. Cyclone preparedness plans are hardly found among these agencies. While it is not possible to prevent natural disasters, protective measures to reduce the vagaries of disasters can be evolved. Due to the unusual climatic behaviour in recent years, people in coastal areas face serious vulnerability, especially in the context of human settlements and consequently move out to the cities to combat the situation. These people need innovative strategies for survival. This paper assert, like many other newly devised coping strategies, that reducing vulnerabilities is important and suggest where innovation \&amp; adaptation is necessary to save communities from their vulnerability to climate change.},

Salt marshes can act as natural buffer zones, providing protection from waves during storms. However, the effectiveness of marshes in protecting the coastline during extreme events when water levels are at a maximum and waves are highest is poorly understood. Here we experimentally assess wave dissipation under storm surge conditions in a 300-metre-long wave flume tank that contains a transplanted section of natural salt marsh. We find that the presence of marsh vegetation causes considerable wave attenuation, even when water levels and waves are highest. From a comparison with experiments without vegetation, we estimate that up to 60\% of observed wave reduction is attributed to vegetation. We also find that although waves progressively flatten and break vegetation stems and thereby reduce dissipation, the marsh substrate remained stable and resistant to surface erosion under all conditions. The effectiveness of storm wave dissipation and the resilience of tidal marshes even at extreme conditions suggest that salt marsh ecosystems can be a valuable component of coastal protection schemes.},

	abstract = {Salt marshes are highly productive coastal wetlands that provide important ecosystem services such as storm protection for coastal cities, nutrient removal and carbon sequestration. Despite protective measures, however, worldwide losses of these ecosystems have accelerated in recent decades. Here we present data from a nine-year whole-ecosystem nutrient-enrichment experiment. Our study demonstrates that nutrient enrichment, a global problem for coastal ecosystems, can be a driver of salt marsh loss. We show that nutrient levels commonly associated with coastal eutrophication increased above-ground leaf biomass, decreased the dense, below-ground biomass of bank-stabilizing roots, and increased microbial decomposition of organic matter. Alterations in these key ecosystem properties reduced geomorphic stability, resulting in creek-bank collapse with significant areas of creek-bank marsh converted to unvegetated mud. This pattern of marsh loss parallels observations for anthropogenically nutrient-enriched marshes worldwide, with creek-edge and bay-edge marsh evolving into mudflats and wider creeks. Our work suggests that current nutrient loading rates to many coastal ecosystems have overwhelmed the capacity of marshes to remove nitrogen without deleterious effects. Projected increases in nitrogen flux to the coast, related to increased fertilizer use required to feed an expanding human population, may rapidly result in a coastal landscape with less marsh, which would reduce the capacity of coastal regions to provide important ecological and economic services.},

The objective of this project was to observe the degree to which wetland restoration can sequester excess soil nutrients to improve water quality. Soil characteristics at sites in riparian wetlands following the initiation of Redman Point–Loosahatchie Bar Environmental Restoration Project were compared. Field sites were established in the Loosahatchie Chute, based on relative distance south of the notched dikes. Additionally, a natural riparian site was monitored. Soil samples were evaluated for spatial and seasonal differences in moisture content, bulk density, total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). Measurements of total C, total N, and P were reduced at all sites compared to the reference site. Although hydrology has been restored to the wetlands, functionality may take a considerable amount of time to be detectable.},

Yet many of their inhabitants are becoming increasingly vulnerable to flooding and conversions of their land to open ocean. The vulnerability is a result of sediment compaction from the removal of oil, gas and water from the delta's underlying sediments, the trapping of sediment in reservoirs upstream and floodplain engineering in combination with rising global sea level. Here we present an assessment of 33 deltas chosen to represent the world's deltas. We find that in the past decade, 85\% of the deltas experienced severe flooding, resulting in the temporary submergence of 260,000 km2. We conservatively estimate that the delta surface area vulnerable to flooding could increase by 50\% under the current projected values for sea-level rise in the twenty-first century. This figure could increase if the capture of sediment upstream persists and continues to prevent the growth and buffering of the deltas.},

Substrate type and fertilizer amendment had significant effects on plant growth, with the two marsh species responding similarly. Substrate interstitial water {pH} levels appeared to have a direct effect on nutrient availability and subsequent plant growth. Poorest plant growth was observed in drilled cuttings, which had the highest {pH} level of the four substrates (mean = 10.4). Addition of compost to drilled cuttings decreased {pH} (mean = 8.4) and resulted in significantly greater total plant biomass. Compost and control sediments had the most neutral {pH} levels (combined mean = 7.3) and produced greatest total plant biomass.

Separate additions of macronutrients and micronutrients stimulated growth of both plant species. However, the simultaneous addition of macronutrients and micronutrients resulted in significantly greater plant biomass than macronutrient fertilization alone or unfertilized control substrates. These experiments demonstrated that when drilled cuttings were amended with organic compost, and especially macronutrient and micrnutrient fertilizers, plant growth levels were comparable to those observed in natural estuarine sediments.},

A second-generation erosion instrument the Cohesive Strength Meter ({CSM}) designed to measure the critical erosion shear stress (τ{oCr}) of intertidal sediments in situ is described. The {CSM} allows measurements of small-scale spatial and temporal variation of sediment stability to be made on a scale and rapidity previously unachievable. New features of specialized hardware are described and the instrument is empirically calibrated in terms of an equivalent horizontal bed shear stress using quartz sand. Some example results from recent field trials on the Königshafen (Sylt-Rømø Bight) are presented. The erosion characteristics of this intertidal flat varied on a cm scale due to the presence of patchy diatom biofilms. Areas with a diatom biofilm were more stable than those without, giving a biostabilization index of 6·2.},

Despite intensive studies of the turbulence over plant canopies, the study of plant motion induced by wind has often been limited to individual trees or cereal plants. Few models of global canopy motions are available. Moreover the numerical analysis of models that are based on individual stems becomes time consuming when dealing with crops. A model of motion within the canopies is proposed here using a wave propagation equation within a homogenized continuous medium, and a forcing function representing turbulent gusts advected over the canopy. This model is derived from a discrete model of a set of plant shoots represented as individual oscillators, including elastic contacts between shoots. Such contacts induce nonlinearities into the wave equation. A new experimental method to measure stem dynamical properties and elastic collision properties is presented with an illustration on alfalfa stems. Results obtained modeling plant motions in an alfalfa crop are presented.},

Many aspects of this field remain poorly understood and the use of physical models within eco-hydraulics requires advancement in methodological application and substantive understanding. This paper presents a review of the emergent themes from a workshop tasked with identifying the future infrastructure requirements of the next generation of eco-hydraulics researchers. The identified themes are: abiotic factors, adaptation, complexity and feedback, variation, and scale and scaling. The paper examines these themes and identifies how progress on each of them is key to existing and future efforts to progress our knowledge of eco-hydraulic interactions. Examples are drawn from studies on biofilms, plants, and sessile and mobile fauna in shallow water fluvial and marine environments. Examples of research gaps and directions for educational, infrastructural and technological advance are also presented.},

	abstract = {Vegetation is increasingly used to protect artificial and natural slopes against shallow landslides. Mechanically, plant roots reinforce soil along a slope by providing cohesion (cr). cr is usually estimated using either of two models: a Wu and Waldron's Model ({WWM}) or a Fiber Bundle Model ({FBM}). The {WWM} assumes that all fine and medium roots break simultaneously during shearing, whereas the {FBM} assumes progressive breakage of these roots. Both models are based on measurements of root density ({RD}), root tensile strength (Tr) and root orientation (Rf). {RD} is highly variable and influences cr significantly more than the other variables. We investigated {RD} in a mixed forest stand dominated by Fagus sylvatica and Abies alba growing at an altitude of 1400 m and a mixed stand of Abies alba and Picea abies located at 1700 m. We assumed that our sites were composed of different plant functional groups, i.e. (1) only trees and shrubs were present and (2) trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants coexisted within the same site. Results showed that {RD} was significantly influenced by soil depth, tree spatial density and species composition. cr was then estimated by the {WWM} and three different {FBMs}; each {FBM} differed in the manner that load was apportioned to the roots (as a function of root cross-sectional area ({CSA}), root diameter or number of intact roots). Results showed that cr values differed significantly depending on the model used: cr ({FBM}, root number) \&lt; cr ({FBM}, root diameter) \&lt; cr ({FBM}, root {CSA}) \&lt; cr ({WWM}). Through a meta-analysis of literature data relating to changes in Tr with root diameter, we found that compared with other factors, plant functional group had a limited effect on the estimation of cr. The use of a generic equation for Tr is therefore justified when studying the stability of temperate forested slopes with mixed species.},

	abstract = {A descriptive-correlational study of biosolids recycling was conducted in the south-eastern United States to assess current knowledge, attitudes and risk perceptions of participants in two communities that land apply biosolids as part of their waste management programs. One community, Amelia County {VA}, has been outspoken against biosolids recycling in the past, whereas the second community, Knoxville, {TN} region, has voiced few concerns about biosolids recycling. Additionally, gender differences within the entire study population were assessed. A 45-question telephone survey, utilizing a 4-point Likert scale, was developed and administered to 311 randomly selected adults in the two regions. Commonalities identified during the study revealed key risk perceptions by the public regarding biosolids regulations, treatment, and application. Given current perceptions and knowledge, respondents felt that the benefits derived from biosolids recycling do not offset the perceived health and safety risks. However, as distance between application and personal property increased, a decrease in opposition of biosolids reuse became evident for all respondents. Survey participants were dissatisfied with the level of stakeholder involvement in research and decision-making processes concerning biosolids. The outspoken Amelia County residents perceived greater health risks due to inadequate treatment of biosolids and odorous emissions during the application process than the less engaged Knox Metro respondents. Significant gender differences were observed with sampled females perceiving greater risks to health and safety from biosolids recycling than males. There was also indication that decisions and risks were not sufficiently communicated to the public, leading to respondents being inadequately informed about biosolids land application in both communities. Community-specific outreach programs must address these public risk perceptions and the differences in perception caused by gender and issue awareness to assist solid waste managers in developing and implementing successful biosolids land application systems that are acceptable to the public.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: Control of emergent aquatic plants such as tule (Scirpus acutus Muhl.; Bigel.) is of direct interest to managers of surface waters in Western North America. Where conditions of water velocity and depth occur that permit this and similar species to colonize and grow, their clonal habit may restrict, or even block, open channels within several seasons after their establishment. Fortunately, sufficient flow depth and velocity naturally prevent these plants from growing into and blocking channels. We investigated physical constraints for tule stem growth with the ultimate intent to apply this knowledge in rehabilitating 60 miles of the diverted Owens River in Eastern California, presently choked with emergent growth. Bending stress resulting from hydrodynamic drag on tule stems was found to induce lodging; permanent deformation and consequent loss of function. The depth-velocity envelope describing this process (at 95 percent confidence) is {uD}/d= 12.8 where u = average velocity acting upon the stem (m/s), D = local depth of flow (m), and d = tule stem diameter at the point of attachment (m). Maintaining a discharge or reconfiguring a channel so this critical depth-velocity-stem diameter envelope is exceeded (predictable using flow models) through the summer growing period should prevent encroachment into an active channel.},

	abstract = {The need for effective marsh restoration techniques in Louisiana is a pressing issue as the state continues to lose coastal wetlands. Returning spoil banks to canals, known as “backfilling,” is an attractive restoration option because it restores marsh, prevents future wetland loss, and is cost effective. The restoration of 30 canals backfilled 20 years ago was examined in this study and compared to restoration success 5 and 10 years after backfilling. Ultimately, the success of backfilling was controlled by the amount of spoil returned to the canal and the position of the canal in the marsh. Up to 95\% of the spoil area was restored to marsh when the spoil banks were adequately removed, but only 5\% of the spoil area was restored at sites where spoil removal was poor. Restoration of organic matter, bulk density, water content, and plant communities of the former spoil areas was also constrained by the adequacy of spoil removal. Backfilling restored up to 90\% of the organic matter, 92\% of the bulk density, and 93\% of the water content after 20 years at sites where spoil was properly removed. Canals backfilled in areas of intact marsh showed greater restoration success than canals backfilled in highly degraded marshes. This study indicates that the benefits of backfilling continue to increase over time, although complete restoration will take longer than 20 years. Improving the completeness of spoil removal, coupled with appropriate site selection, could speed up the restoration process and enhance the success of future backfilling projects.},

The mechanistic studies revealed the substrate-inhibitor interaction to be the overall major mechanism of inhibition. This interaction was shown to involve substrate depletion, probably involving some primary sites of the natural substrate casein. Some inhibition was also shown to be due to an interaction between the enzyme and the inhibitior molecules. The interactions of the inhibitor with the enzyme and the substrate were irreversible.

We use this index to identify the most vulnerable people and property as indicated by being in the upper quartile of hazard for the nation’s coastline. The number of people, poor families, elderly and total value of residential property that are most exposed to hazards can be reduced by half if existing coastal habitats remain fully intact. Coastal habitats defend the greatest number of people and total property value in Florida, New York and California. Our analyses deliver the first national map of risk reduction owing to natural habitats and indicates where conservation and restoration of reefs and vegetation have the greatest potential to protect coastal communities.},

	abstract = {The coupling of geomorphological and ecological processes is critical for the maintenance or disappearance of salt marshes. Emergent macrophytes dampen wave- and tide-generated shear stresses, promoting sediment deposition and marsh formation. The complex interactions among marsh primary productivity, sea level, and sedimentation determine the equilibrium elevation of the marsh platform and its resilience against external drivers. The strength of the root system can affect the ability of marsh edge scarps to resist erosion. Some marshes are commonly inhabited by a number of species of crab, whose burrows have been implicated in marsh-edge erosion, whereas mussels and other bivalves can be very important in stabilizing marsh sediment by both slowing wave and current velocities and binding sediment to the root mat. Nutrient enrichment has the potential to invoke negative feedbacks that will ultimately affect marsh geomorphic configuration and biogeochemical cycling, by altering plant production and community characteristics and increasing microbial decomposition of organic matter. In this chapter, we present a broad overview of the feedbacks between biota and sedimentological processes in salt marshes, including recent numerical models that have been utilized to study the ecogeomorphic evolution of intertidal areas.},

	abstract = {The relations among marsh elevation, flooding frequency and duration, and marsh accretion in a Spartina alterniflora marsh in coastal Louisiana were evaluated over a 39-month period by using field surveys, tide gauge records, and direct measures of recent accretion above artificial soil markers. New sample plots were randomly selected at the beginning of each of two time periods, April 1988-March 1990 (Period 1) and December 1989-July 1991 (Period 2), and vertical accretion was measured seasonally during both periods. Hydroperiod was calculated for each plot by using the mean elevation of the marsh surface at each plot and local tide gauge records. The range in elevations of the Period 1 field plots (2.1 cm) differed considerably from Period 2 field plots (12.1 cm). Marsh surface topography exerted a strong influence on the frequency and duration of marsh surface flooding, with plots at lower elevations flooded a greater percentage of the time than plots at higher elevations (41 vs. 37\% for Period 1; 73 vs. 50\% for Period 2). Accretion was significantly related to duration of flooding during both periods (p = 0.037, Period 1; p = 0.019, Period 2). Accumulation of both organic and mineral matter was also significantly related to duration of flooding (p = 0.007, organic; p = 0.009, mineral), implying that allochthonous organic matter as well as mineral matter was delivered to the marsh surface during flooding. These data indicate that accretion and accumulation varied temporally and spatially in relation to hydroperiod and suggest that accretion at lower marsh elevations is not always sufficient to maintain an equilibrium position in the intertidal zone.},

	abstract = {The modeling of fluid–structure interactions, such as flow-induced vibrations, is a well-developed field of mechanical engineering. Many methods exist, and it seems natural to apply them to model the behavior of plants, and potentially other cantilever-like biological structures, under flow. Overcoming this disciplinary divide, and the application of such models to biological systems, will significantly advance our understanding of ecological patterns and processes and improve our predictive capabilities. Nonetheless, several methodological issues must first be addressed, which I describe here using two practical examples that have strong similarities: one from agricultural sciences and the other from nuclear engineering. Very similar issues arise in both: individual and collective behavior, small and large space and time scales, porous modeling, standard and extreme events, trade-off between the surface of exchange and individual or collective risk of damage, variability, hostile environments and, in some aspects, evolution. The conclusion is that, although similar issues do exist, which need to be exploited in some detail, there is a significant gap that requires new developments. It is obvious that living plants grow in and adapt to their environment, which certainly makes plant biomechanics fundamentally distinct from classical mechanical engineering. Moreover, the selection processes in biology and in human engineering are truly different, making the issue of safety different as well. A thorough understanding of these similarities and differences is needed to work efficiently in the application of a mechanistic approach to ecology.},

One of the in-bay disposal sites was physically blockaded by a flotilla of fishing boats and other vessels and dredging in San Francisco Bay was temporary halted. Therefore, in 1990 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers initiated a long-range interagency planning process for dredged material management for the San Francisco Bay. This effort resulted in the Long Term Management Strategy ({LTMS}) for the Placement of Dredged Material in the San Francisco Bay Region. This Paper presents a history of some of the events leading up to the crisis, the development of the {LTMS} plan and the actions now being taken to implement this program. It also discusses the importance of consensus building, some of the lessons learned and what has worked best during this process.},

	abstract = {Contrasting soil conditions caused by different inundation frequenciesrequire different root growth strategies along the elevational gradient ofcoastal salt marshes. The objective of this study was to examine (1) if rootlifespan was shorter in Elymus pycnanthus, a relativelyfast-growing competitive species dominating high marshes, than {inSpartina} anglica, a relatively slow-growingstress-tolerating species dominating low marshes, and (2) if the species withlonger lifespan had higher tissue density (g cm−3) and lowerspecific root length (m g−1) than the species with shorterlifespan. Root production and mortality rates were established by samplingrootsin in-growth cores, and using triphenyltetrazolium chloride ({TTC}) staining todistinguish vital from dead roots. Root lifespan was estimated by dividing theliving root biomass (Elymus: 36 gm−2, Spartina: 100 gm−2) by root production (Elymus:0.28 g day−1 m−2,Spartina: 0.25 g day−1m−2) or root mortality rates(Elymus: 0.42–0.53 g day−1m−2). Spartina did not exhibitsubstantial mortality. Despite the present method only yielding rough estimatesof average root lifespan, it is evident that root longevity is much shorter {inElymus} than in Spartina. Rootlifespanranged between 10–19 weeks for Elymus but was closeto 1 year in Spartina, indicating {thatElymus} replaces it's roots continuously throughout thegrowing season, whereas Spartina maintains its roots overthe growing season. Fine roots of Elymus had slightlylowertissue density (0.094) than those of Spartina (0.139),whereas coarse roots of Elymus {andSpartina} had similar tissue density (0.100 gcm−3). Fine roots of Elymus {andSpartina} had similar specific root length (195 mg−1). However, coarse roots {ofElymus} (50 m g−1) had higherspecific root length than those of Spartina (20 mg−1) due to having smaller root diameter(Elymus: 548 μm,Spartina: 961 μm). We conclude thatpresentobservations on Elymus and Spartinasupport our first hypothesis that the ‘competitive’ species fromthehigh marsh had short-lived roots compared to the'stress-tolerating'species from the low marsh. However, our result provide only weak support forthe existence of a positive correlation between root longevity and tissuedensity and a negative correlation between root longevity and specific rootlength.},

	abstract = {The relationship between marsh edge and animal use was examined in a {plantedSpartina} alterniflora marsh located in the Galveston Bay system of Texas. A completely randomized block experimental design was used with each of four blocks containing a control and experimental sector. Marsh edge was increased through the construction of channels in experimental sectors. Channel construction had no detectable effect on marsh surface elevation. Effects of these simulated tidal creeks on habitat use were examined by sampling nekton at high tide with drop enclosures both on the marsh surface and within the channels. Crustaceans dominated the nekton, and use of the marsh surface in experimental sectors was significantly higher than in controls; densities of brown {shrimpPenaeus} aztecus, white {shrimpP}. setiferus, and daggerblade grass {shrimpPalaemonetes} pugio were 4.6 to 13 times higher near the channels. Polychaete densities in marsh sediments were also significantly higher near channels, and densities of decapod predators were positively correlated with densities of these infaunal prey. Thus, channel effects on natant decapods may have been related to the distribution of prey organisms. However, increased densities of natant fauna along the channel edge may simply reflect a requirement for departure from the marsh surface at low tide. Marshsurface densities of small bait fishes, bay {anchovyAnchoa} mitchilli and the inland {silversideMenidia} beryllina, also increased near channels, but highest densities of these fishes were in the creeks themselves. The abundance and distribution of juvenile blue {crabsCallinectes} sapidus and gulf marsh fiddler {crabsUca} longisignalis were not affected by the addition of experimental channels. Overall, the study results indicate that habitat value of created salt marshes can be enhanced by incorporating tidal creeks into the marsh design.},

Some inhibition was also shown to be due to an interaction between the enzyme and the inhibitior molecules. The interactions of the inhibitor with the enzyme and the substrate were irreversible.

There is growing understanding of the array of factors that affect the strength or efficacy of these ecosystem services in different locations, as well as management interventions which may restore or enhance such values. Improved understanding and application of such knowledge will form a critical part of coastal adaptation planning, likely reducing the need for expensive engineering options in some locations, and providing a complementary tool in hybrid engineering design. Irrespective of future climate change, coastal hazards already impact countless communities and the appropriate use of ecosystem-based adaptation strategies offers a valuable and effective tool for present-day management. Maintaining and enhancing coastal systems will also support the continued provision of other coastal services, including the provision of food and maintenance of coastal resource dependent livelihoods.},

	abstract = {Spartina alterniflora was first introduced into south San Francisco Bay in the 1970’s. Since that time it has spread to new areas within the south bay and is especially well established at four sites. The spread of this introduced species was evaluated by comparing its vegetative and reproductive characteristics to the native cordgrass, Spartina foliosa. The characters studied were intertidal distribution, phenology, aboveground and belowground biomass, growth rates, seed production, and germination rates. Spartina alterniflora has a wider intertidal distribution than S. foliosa and outproduced the native cordgrass in all aspects that were studied. These results indicate that the introduced species has a much better chance of becoming established in new areas than the native species, and once established, it spreads more rapidly vegetatively than the native species. Spartina alterniflora is likely to continue to spread to new areas in the bay and displace the native plant. In addition, this introduced species may effect sedimentation dynamics, available detritus, benthic algal production, wrack deposition and disturbance, habitat structure for native wetland animals, benthic invertebrate populations, and shorebird and wading bird foraging areas. *** {DIRECT} {SUPPORT} *** A01BY058 00013},

	abstract = {Poised at the interface of rivers, ocean, atmosphere and dense human settlement, estuaries are driven by a large array of natural and anthropogenic forces. San Francisco Bay exemplifies the fast-paced change occurring in many of the world's estuaries, bays, and inland seas in response to these diverse forces. We use observations from this particularly well-studied estuary to illustrate responses to six drivers that are common agents of change where land and sea meet: water consumption and diversion, human modification of sediment supply, introduction of nonnative species, sewage input, environmental policy, and climate shifts. In San Francisco Bay, responses to these drivers include, respectively, shifts in the timing and extent of freshwater inflow and salinity intrusion, decreasing turbidity, restructuring of plankton communities, nutrient enrichment, elimination of hypoxia and reduced metal contamination of biota, and food web changes that decrease resistance of the estuary to nutrient pollution. Detection of these changes and discovery of their causes through environmental monitoring have been essential for establishing and measuring outcomes of environmental policies that aim to maintain high water quality and sustain services provided by estuarine-coastal ecosystems. The many time scales of variability and the multiplicity of interacting drivers place heavy demands on estuarine monitoring programs, but the San Francisco Bay case study illustrates why the imperative for monitoring has never been greater.},

	abstract = {The process of nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-damo) was recently discovered and shown to be mediated by “Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera” (M. oxyfera). Here, evidence for n-damo in three different freshwater wetlands located in southeastern China was obtained using stable isotope measurements, quantitative {PCR} assays, and 16S {rRNA} and particulate methane monooxygenase gene clone library analyses. Stable isotope experiments confirmed the occurrence of n-damo in the examined wetlands, and the potential n-damo rates ranged from 0.31 to 5.43 nmol {CO}2 per gram of dry soil per day at different depths of soil cores. A combined analysis of 16S {rRNA} and particulate methane monooxygenase genes demonstrated that M. oxyfera-like bacteria were mainly present in the deep soil with a maximum abundance of 3.2 × 107 gene copies per gram of dry soil. It is estimated that ∼0.51 g of {CH}4 m−2 per year could be linked to the n-damo process in the examined wetlands based on the measured potential n-damo rates. This study presents previously unidentified confirmation that the n-damo process is a previously overlooked microbial methane sink in wetlands, and n-damo has the potential to be a globally important methane sink due to increasing nitrogen pollution.},

This results in complex and interdependent problems. Addressing these problems requires the involvement of decision-makers, researchers and other societal actors in knowledge production. However, such means of knowledge production are poorly understood when it comes to coastal regions. Using a conceptual framework that makes a distinction between project arrangements and knowledge arrangements, this paper analyses interactive knowledge development in a nature restoration project on the {US} West Coast. The project adopted a collaborative approach, and involved diverse organisations in developing knowledge for reaching its restoration solutions. The case study analysis results in seven causal mechanisms. The mechanisms are divided into two groups. One group discusses processes that affect interactive knowledge development, such as the need for public support. The other group explains how interactive knowledge development functions, for example through facilitation and the creation of safe environments for researchers and regulators. Through identifying these mechanisms, this paper contributes to an improved understanding of interactive knowledge development in coastal regions.},

	abstract = {A growth experiment with native plants in pots exposed to natural environmental conditions evaluates the use of sewage sludge as a soil amendment in restoration of a southern California salt marsh. Sludge containing desirable organic matter but also undesirable heavy metal contaminants was mixed with a readily available matrix soil to reduce metal concentrations to levels below legal limits for land applications of sludge. Soil nutrient analysis revealed expected increases in total nitrogen and total phosphorus content with increasing sludge concentration. Soil metals analysis, however, revealed decreases in metal content with increased sludge concentration, a trend evidently caused by higher than expected metal content in the matrix soil. Five artificial soil mixtures ranging from 0 to 70\% sludge were accompanied by natural wetland soil controls. Pots containing these soils were placed into a natural salt marsh. The pots were then planted with two native salt marsh plant species, Salicornia virginica and Frankenia grandifolia. Aboveground biomass was harvested after 12 months. Plant growth displayed no obvious change with increasing sludge concentration. Over the concentration ranges used, increased nutrient content did not stimulate plant growth and increased metal content did not inhibit plant growth. Plants grew better in natural wetland soil than in artificial soil mixtures, a trend probably caused by the substantially finer texture and higher organic content of natural soil. All sludge treatments differed more from the natural soil than from each other, implying that within the ranges examined, soil texture and organic content exerted more influence on plant growth than did metal or nutrient concentration. These results suggest that incorporating this sewage sludge in the soil of the restored salt marsh will neither benefit nor harm the plants that will live there and that greatest plant growth will be achieved by mixing the sludge with a fine-grained matrix soil.},

We aimed to understand how fine root structure enables sustained ecosystem metabolism through a summer of limited moisture and high heat and facilitates resource acquisition during the short period of high resource supply. An additional goal was to provide a basis for upscaling root biomass and soil carbon to the landscape scale. We sampled trees of different size and tree clusters via a stratified sampling scheme that accounted for spatial heterogeneity in root biomass and soil carbon with lateral distance from the tree bole, or cluster centre, and soil depth. We upscaled these estimates using site-specific information from a lidar survey. We found that fine roots and soil carbon are spatially heterogeneous in their landscape distribution and greatly increase with tree size. We also found that Q. douglasii possesses a dimorphic fine root architecture, uniquely suited to the region's climatic constraints and exhibits morphological plasticity among trees of different size and physical setting.

Inbreeding depression was high in the parental species and early generation hybrids, but was much reduced in later generation hybrids-some even showed outbreeding depression. We found that populations of later generation hybrids and their seedling progeny were almost two-fold more homozygous than early generation hybrids, consistent with the evidence of increased selfing shown by our parentage analyses based upon 17 microsatellite markers.

	abstract = {Due to pressure for land, substantial areas of peat swamps in South-East Asia have been and presently are being reclaimed for agriculture or for other land use. As soon as peat swamps are drained, the irreversible process of subsidence starts, which can only be stopped by waterlogging the peat again. Long-term subsidence recordings for a project area in peninsular Malaysia were analyzed, resulting in the quantification of relationships between subsidence and time as well as between subsidence and water management. The average subsidence rate for the area was found to be 2 cm per year. Consequences of this average subsidence rate were evaluated in terms of the risk that acid sulphate soils, which often underlie the peat, might surface.

The established relation between subsidence and groundwater level proved to give an adequate description of the observed parabolic shape of the ground levels between two drainage canals. Compared to subsidence rates for more temperate regions, the rates for Malaysia were high. The oxidation and shrinkage components of total subsidence were quantified and the contribution of subsidence to the emission of {CO}2 was estimated to be 27 tonnes per hectare per year.

To alleviate the negative consequences of drainage of peat swamps, it is recommended to shift from a drainage system that focuses on discharge of excess water towards a system that combines drainage and water conservation, allowing the maintenance of constant high groundwater levels and thus reducing subsidence.},

Soil samples were collected in 2006 at plow layer from fields that received liquid and dry municipal biosolids application from 1972 to 2004 at the cumulative rate of 1416 Mg ha−1 in mined soil and 1072 Mg ha−1 in nonmined soil and control fields that received chemical fertilizer at Fulton County, western Illinois. The biosolids application increased the soil microbial biomass C ({SMBC}) by 5-fold in mined soil and 4-fold in nonmined soil. The biosolids-amended soils showed a high amount of basal respiration and N mineralization, but low metabolic quotient, and low rate of organic C and organic N mineralization. There was a remarkable increase in mineral-associated organic C from 6.9 g kg−1 (fertilizer control) to 26.6 g kg−1 (biosolids-amended) in mined soil and from 8.9 g kg−1 (fertilizer control) to 23.1 g kg−1 (biosolids-amended) in nonmined soil. The amorphous Fe and Al, which can improve {SOM} stability, were increased by 2–7 folds by the long-term biosolids application. It is evident from this study that the biosolids-modified {SOM} resists to decomposition more than that in the fertilizer treatment, thus long-term biosolids application could increase {SOM} stability.},

We focus on well- and partially mixed systems that are long relative to the tidal excursion. Dynamics of the coupled system of width- and tidally averaged momentum and salt equations are now better understood owing to the development of simple numerical solution techniques. These have led to a greater appreciation of the key role played by the time dependency of the length of the salt intrusion. Improved realism in simplified tidally averaged physics has been driven by simultaneous advances in our understanding of the detailed dynamics within the tidal cycle and across irregular channel cross-sections. The complex interactions of turbulence, stratification, and advection are now understood well enough to motivate a new generation of physically plausible mixing parameterizations for the tidally averaged equations.},

	title = {Spatiotemporal dynamics of carbon dioxide and methane fluxes from  agricultural and restored wetlands in the California Delta},
	url = {http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/8857w19f},
	abstract = {The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California was drained for agriculture and human settlement over a century ago, resulting in extreme rates of soil subsidence and release of {CO}2 to the atmosphere from peat oxidation. Because of this century-long ecosystem carbon imbalance where heterotrophic respiration exceeded net primary productivity, most of the land surface in the Delta is now up to 8 meters below sea level. To potentially reverse this trend of chronic carbon loss from Delta ecosystems, land managers have begun converting drained lands back to flooded ecosystems, but at the cost of increased production of {CH}4, a much more potent greenhouse gas than {CO}2.  To evaluate the impacts of inundation on the biosphere-atmophere exchange of {CO}2 and {CH}4 in the Delta, I first measured and analyzed net fluxes of {CO}2 and {CH}4 for two continuous years with the eddy covariance technique in a drained peatland pasture and a recently re-flooded rice paddy. This analysis demonstrated that the drained pasture was a consistent large source of {CO}2 and small source of {CH}4, whereas the rice paddy was a mild sink for {CO}2 and a mild source of {CH}4. However more importantly, this first analysis revealed nuanced complexities for measuring and interpreting patterns in {CO}2 and {CH}4 fluxes through time and space. {CO}2 and {CH}4 fluxes are inextricably linked in flooded ecosystems, as plant carbon serves as the primary substrate for the production of {CH}4 and wetland plants also provide the primary transport pathway of {CH}4 flux to the atmosphere. At the spatially homogeneous rice paddy during the summer growing season, I investigated rapid temporal coupling between {CO}2 and {CH}4 fluxes. Through wavelet Granger-causality analysis, I demonstrated that daily fluctuations in growing season gross ecosystem productivity (photosynthesis) exert a stronger control than temperature on the diurnal pattern in {CH}4 flux from rice. At a spatially heterogeneous restored wetland site, I analyzed the spatial coupling between net {CO}2 and {CH}4 fluxes by characterizing two-dimensional patterns of emergent vegetation within eddy covariance flux footprints. I combined net {CO}2 and {CH}4 fluxes from three eddy flux towers with high-resolution remote sensing imagery classified for emergent vegetation and an analytical 2-D flux footprint model to assess the impact of vegetation fractal pattern and abundance on the measured flux. Both emergent vegetation abundance and fractal complexity are important metrics for constraining variability within {CO}2 and {CH}4 flux in this complex landscape.Scaling between carbon flux measurements at individual sites and regional scales depends on the connection to remote sensing metrics that can be broadly applied. In the final chapter of this dissertation, I analyzed a long term dataset of hyperspectral ground reflectance measurements collected within the flux tower footprints of three structurally similar yet functionally diverse ecosystems: an annual grassland, a degraded pepperweed pasture, and a rice paddy. The normalized difference vegetation index ({NDVI}) was highly correlated with landscape-scale photosynthesis across all sites, however this work also revealed new potential spectral indices with high correlation to both net and partitioned {CO}2 fluxes. This analysis within this dissertation serves as a framework for considering the impacts of temporal and spatial heterogeneity on measured landscape-scale fluxes of {CO}2 and {CH}4. Scaling measurements through time and space is especially critical for interpreting fluxes of trace gases with a high degree of temporal heterogeneity, like {CH}4 and N2O, from landscapes that have a high degree of spatial heterogeneity, like wetlands. This work articulates a strong mechanistic connection between {CO}2 and {CH}4 fluxes in wetland ecosystems, and provides important management considerations for implementing and monitoring inundated land-use conversion as an effective carbon management strategy in the California Delta.},

Inadequate accretion and subsequent conversion of coastal marshes to open water generally is attributed to inadequate mineral sedimentation because mineral sedimentation is widely assumed to control accretion. Using 137Cs dating to determine vertical accretion, mineral sedimentation, and organic matter accumulation, we found that accretion varied with organic accumulation rather than mineral sedimentation across a wide range of conditions in coastal Louisiana, including stable marshes where soil was 80\% mineral matter. These results agreed with previous research, but no mechanism had been proposed to explain accretion via vegetative growth. In an exploratory greenhouse experiment, we found that flooding stimulated root growth above the marsh surface. These results indicated the need for additional work to determine if flooding controls accretion in some marshes by stimulating root growth on the marsh surface, rather than by mineral accumulation on the marsh surface. Restoration or management that focus on mineral sedimentation may be ineffective where a relationship between accretion and mineral sedimentation is assumed rather than tested.},

Consequently, large-scale organized vortices are induced, which dominate the momentum transfer and scalar concentration among canopies. The downstream advection of coherent vortices causes the coherent waving of aquatic vegetation, referred to as Monami. However, the flow-visualization techniques such as {PIV} have not been sufficiently applied to these complicated flows in previous studies, such that no detailed information on the interaction between the flow field and the plant motion exists. Simultaneous measurements of turbulence and vegetation motion were conducted herein for open-channel flows with flexible vegetation by using a combination of {PIV} and {PTV} techniques. The former part of this study focuses on the effects of Monami phenomena on mean-flow and turbulence structures. The latter part examines an interaction between the coherent structure and the vegetation motion.},

	abstract = {Coastal flood damage and adaptation costs under 21st century sea-level rise are assessed on a global scale taking into account a wide range of uncertainties in continental topography data, population data, protection strategies, socioeconomic development and sea-level rise. Uncertainty in global mean and regional sea level was derived from four different climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, each combined with three land-ice scenarios based on the published range of contributions from ice sheets and glaciers. Without adaptation, 0.2–4.6\% of global population is expected to be flooded annually in 2100 under 25–123 cm of global mean sea-level rise, with expected annual losses of 0.3–9.3\% of global gross domestic product. Damages of this magnitude are very unlikely to be tolerated by society and adaptation will be widespread. The global costs of protecting the coast with dikes are significant with annual investment and maintenance costs of {US}\$ 12–71 billion in 2100, but much smaller than the global cost of avoided damages even without accounting for indirect costs of damage to regional production supply. Flood damages by the end of this century are much more sensitive to the applied protection strategy than to variations in climate and socioeconomic scenarios as well as in physical data sources (topography and climate model). Our results emphasize the central role of long-term coastal adaptation strategies. These should also take into account that protecting large parts of the developed coast increases the risk of catastrophic consequences in the case of defense failure.},

In order to highlight their impact on soil properties and evaluate their possible deleterious effects, soil functional parameters (soil microbial biomass, soil enzyme activities, and soil bacterial population) were used. Outcomes showed that the increase of the application rate had significant impact on microbial biomass carbon, which increased by 5\%, 9\% and 21\% in 1 ×, 3 × and 6 × with respect to the untreated soil. Biosolid application rate influenced soil enzyme activities, such as β-glucosidase, dehydrogenase, protease and alkaline phosphomonoesterase which sharply increased at 3 × and 6 ×, especially in the soils amended with the aerobic biosolid. Soil total bacterial population proved to be stable and not affected, at any dose, by biosolid addition.
Concerning total trace metals, no dose effect was registered, as their concentrations were the same for each dose and treatment; on the contrary, available copper diminished with application rate. On the whole, soil functionality was not negatively affected by biosolid application.},

The difference between the kinetic scale and the smallest flux scale, the plot scale, is large. A stepwise scaling up procedure was therefore used in a series of three papers. This paper treats kinetics and diffusion around a single gas-transporting root. Kinetic processes include methane production, methane oxidation, electron acceptor reduction, electron acceptor reoxidation, and aerobic respiration. This is the minimum number of processes needed to relate net methane production to the main driving variables: carbon availability and oxygen inflow. Kinetics were integrated with diffusion, leading to a set of partial differential equations. This set was solved directly and also after simplification to a set of spatially averaged ordinary differential equations. Results of the simplified model closely resembled results of the unsimplified (full) model, which implies that the simplified model covers the main interactions of the full model and is suitable for further scaling up. Model results showed that reduction of methane emission after 100\% specific inhibition of methane oxidation may not result in a reliable estimate of methane oxidation, firstly because of changes in the oxygen dynamics which directly or indirectly affects methane production and secondly because of transient effects.},

	abstract = {In terrestrial ecosystems, plant growth, plant community structure, and ultimately the ecosystem services provided by plants are dependent on the presence and composition of below ground arbuscular mycorrhizal ({AM}) fungal communities. {AM} fungi form obligate symbioses with plants providing nutrients to their host plants in exchange for photosynthates. While {AM} have been found in most wetland ecosystems, the effects of urban contaminants on {AM} associations are largely unknown. Triclosan (5-chloro-2-[2,4-dichlorophenoxy]phenol; {TCS}) is a widespread contaminant found in surface waters throughout North America and in addition to antimicrobial properties is purported to have antifungal properties. To determine the effects of {TCS} on arbuscular mycorrhizal associations, we exposed {AM} inoculated wetland plant species (Eclipta prostrata, Hibiscus laevis, and Sesbania herbacea) to {TCS} at concentrations of 0.0, 0.4 and 4.0 μg/L in a continuous flow-through exposure system. {TCS} exposure caused significant reductions in hyphal and arbuscular colonization while no significant effect was detected for vesicular colonization. Across all species, hyphal colonization was significantly higher in controls (18.58 ± 1.84\%) compared to 0.4 and 4.0 μg/L (10.20 ± 1.34\% and 9.86 ± 1.32\% respectively) {TCS} treatments. Similarly, arbuscular colonization was significantly higher in the controls (4.58 ± 0.75\%) compared to 0.4 μg/L (2.20 ± 0.38\%) and 4.0 μg/L (1.22 ± 0.24\%) {TCS} exposures.

	abstract = {Since 1972 over 940 ha (2,300 ac) of leveed former salt marsh sites around San Francisco Bay have been restored to tidal action, purposely or through natural processes. The evolution of these sites can inform predictions of rates of marshplain evolution and establishment of tidal channel systems. A review of the history of 15 re-flooded sites ranging in size from 18 to 220 ha (45 to 550 ac) and in age from 2 to 29 years indicates that marshplain vegetation with more than 50\% cover was established at nine of the sites within 4 to 20 years. The remaining six sites aged 2 to approximately 20 years continue to be less than 50\% vegetated. The evolution of these sites is consistent with the following simple conceptual model of the physical evolution of restored tidal marshes in subsided breached sites. Initially, deposition of estuarine sediment builds up mudflats that allow vegetation establishment once elevations are high enough for vegetation to survive. Sites that are initially lower in the tidal frame take longer to vegetate than those that are initially higher. Three factors appear to retard the time frame for vegetation establishment: limited estuarine suspended sediment supply, erosion of deposited estuarine muds by internally generated wind waves, and restricted tidal exchange. These factors affect evolution more significantly in larger sites. The comparatively short time frame for vegetation colonization and marshplain evolution experienced in earlier, smaller, and/or less subsided breached levee restorations may not necessarily be replicable by simple levee breaching on larger subsided restoration sites now being planned. Our review of the 15 sites also indicates that the formation of tidal channels within the marshes is greatly dependent on whether and how high the site was filled before breaching. Filled sites at high intertidal elevations (above approximately 0.3 m below mean higher high water) can vegetate quickly but after several decades may show little development of tidal channels.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a wetland elevation/sediment accretion model for a subsiding forested wetland located within the coastal zone of Louisiana, {USA}. We designed the model to determine if the addition of secondarily treated municipal wastewater to the wetland could stimulate organic matter production and deposition to the point that sediment accretion would balance relative sea level rise (deep subsidence plus eustatic sea level rise ({ESLR})). We also used the model to simulate the effect of predicted increases in {ESLR} on wetland stability and to determine the amount of additional mineral sediment that would be required to compensate for relative sea level rise. The model utilizes a cohort approach to simulate sediment dynamics (organic and mineral matter accretion, decomposition, compaction, and below-ground productivity) and yields total sediment height as an output. Sediment height is balanced with {ESLR} and deep subsidence, both forcing functions, to calculate wetland elevation relative to mean water levels. The model also simulates primary production (roots, leaves, wood, and floating aquatic vegetation) and mineral matter deposition, both of which are feedback functions of elevation. Simulated wetland elevation was more sensitive to the uncertainty surrounding estimates of deep subsidence and future {ESLR} rates than in other processes that affect wetland elevation and could be influenced by wastewater (i.e. rates of decomposition and primary productivity). The model projected that, although the addition of wastewater effluent would increase long term accretion rates from 0.35 to 0.46 cm year−1, it would not be enough to offset the current rate of relative sea level rise. A series of mineral input simulations revealed that, given no increase in {ESLR} rates, an additional 3000 g m−2 year−1 of mineral sediments would be required to maintain a stable elevation.},

These levees have altered hydrology and ecology and are a primary cause of massive wetland loss in the delta. River water is being re-introduced into coastal basins as part of a large-scale ecological engineering effort to restore the delta. We quantified freshwater, nitrogen, and phosphorus inputs to the Breton Sound Estuary for three climatically different years (2000, 2001, and 2002). Water budgets included precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, the diversion, stormwater pumps, and groundwater. Precipitation contributed 48–57\% of freshwater input, while the diversion accounted for 33–48\%. Net groundwater input accounted for less than 0.05\% of freshwater inputs. Inputs of ammonium ({NH}4-N), nitrate ({NO}3-N), total nitrogen ({TN}), and total phosphorus ({TP}) were determined for each of the water sources. Atmospheric deposition was the most important input of {NH}4-N (57–62\% or 1.44 × 105–2.32 × 105 kg yr−1) followed by the diversion. The diversion was the greatest source of {NO}3-N (67–83\%, 7.78 × 105–1.64 × 106 kg yr−1) and {TN} (60–71\%). The diversion contributed 41–60\% of {TP} input (1.17 × 105–2.32 × 105 kg yr−1). Annual loading rates of {NH}4-N and {NO}3-N were 0.17–0.27 and 1.2–2.3 g N m−2 yr−1, respectively, for the total basin indicating strong retention of nitrogen in the basin.

Deposition-prone floccules form over a wide range of experimental conditions, which suggests an underlying universal process. Floccule ripples develop into low-angle foresets and mud beds that appear laminated after postdepositional compaction, but the layers retain signs of floccule ripple bedding that would be detectable in the rock record. Because mudstones were long thought to record low-energy conditions of offshore and deeper water environments, our results call for reevaluation of published interpretations of ancient mudstone successions and derived paleoceanographic conditions.},

	abstract = {To investigate the effects of wave shape on cohesive sediment flux in shallow-water environments, a 1-dimensional vertical (1DV) model for cohesive sediment transport previously validated with field measurement is applied to conditions of skewed and asymmetric oscillatory flows. Cohesive sediments usually portray behaviors different from those of non-cohesive sediments. This is mainly due to the flocculation process through which the density and the size of cohesive sediment change continuously. Therefore, a robust flocculation model is incorporated with a 1DV model in this study. Under the condition of skewed oscillatory flow (2nd order Stokes wave-type oscillatory flow), the flux of cohesive sediment is significantly affected by the change of flow skewness whereas the flux of non-cohesive sediment of which size is 100 μm does not show a clear relationship with skewness. Under the condition of forward-leaning asymmetric oscillatory flow (saw-tooth wave-type oscillatory flow), the direction of cohesive sediment flux is negative whereas the flux of non-cohesive sediment shows the positive direction. As the main mechanism of these behaviors, the phase-lag effect is considered. The interactional relationship between the settling velocity, the variation of concentration profile and hydrodynamics of carrier fluid enhances the phase-lag effect and causes different behaviors in cohesive sediment compared to the flux of fine non-cohesive sediment.},

The assemblages recolonising both schemes were consistently less speciose, less densely-populated and exhibited multivariate community structures that differed from those of the reference areas. However, for both schemes metrics of functionality converged to those of reference areas, although some differences in trait composition persisted for up to 3 years.
These data support the proposition that impacts of, and recovery from, anthropogenic disturbance should be assessed using a combination of both functional and taxonomic structural approaches.},

The surge amplitude decreases at a rate of 40–50 cm/km across the mangrove forest and at a rate of 20 cm/km across the areas with a mixture of mangrove islands with open water. In contrast, the amplitudes of storm surges at the front of the mangrove zone increase by about 10–30\% because of the “blockage” of mangroves to surge water, which can cause greater impacts on structures at the front of mangroves than the case without mangroves. The mangrove forest can also protect the wetlands behind the mangrove zone against surge inundation from a Category 5 hurricane with a fast forward speed of 11.2 m/s (25 mph). However, the forest cannot fully attenuate storm surges from a Category 5 hurricane with a slow forward speed of 2.2 m/s (5 mph) and reduced surges can still affect the wetlands behind the mangrove zone. The effects of widths of mangrove zones on reducing surge amplitudes are nonlinear with large reduction rates (15–30\%) for initial width increments and small rates ({\textless}5\%) for subsequent width increments.},

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for {GHG} Inventory on Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Uses provide an adequate framework for emissions inventories in these ecosystems; however, specific emission factors are needed for more accurate and cost-effective monitoring. The emissions are governed by complex biophysical processes, such as peat decomposition and compaction, nutrient availability, soil water content, and water table level, all of which are affected by management practices. We estimate that total carbon loss from converting peat swamp forests into oil palm is 59.4 ± 10.2 Mg of {CO}2 per hectare per year during the first 25 y after land-use cover change, of which 61.6\% arise from the peat. Of the total amount (1,486 ± 183 Mg of {CO}2 per hectare over 25 y), 25\% are released immediately from land-clearing fire. In order to maintain high palm-oil production, nitrogen inputs through fertilizer are needed and the magnitude of the resulting increased N2O emissions compared to {CO}2 losses remains unclear.},

In areas of rapid relative sea-level rise, as in the Mississippi Delta, it is generally accepted that a supply of sediment in flood water and mineral sedimentation are critical to sustaining wetlands. But plans to create diversions have raised questions about the collateral effects of nutrients carried in the Mississippi River, effects that may contravene the benefits of sediment. This review finds the balance of empirical and theoretical evidence supports that nutrients benefit above- and belowground plant production and that fresh water and sediment diversions can be effective and beneficial for restoring wetlands in the Delta, especially if designed to maximize sediment inputs. The input of sediment, nutrients, and fresh water will change the community composition of some wetlands and their biogeochemical processes. Most of the nitrogen input should be assimilated or denitrified. Labile organic matter is likely to degrade more quickly, but labile organic matter does not add ‘new’ soil volume and its speed of decay is of little consequence. Additional research is needed before we fully understand the consequences of nutrients on the preservation of organic matter in sediment, but building on what is known of the activities of lignin-degrading fungi and their enzymes, it is likely that refractory organic matter should increase and contribute positively to sediment accretion.},

In standardized experiments guinea pigs were subjected in groups of 20 to three identical head injuries, each of either 1.0 J or 1.5 J intensity. The trauma was likely to result in a concussion or contusion syndrome similar to that found in man; 40 animals served as controls. During the 60 min after injury observation and measurement of body functions did not reveal signs of a shock-like condition or hypoxaemia in the traumatized animals compared with control animals. Superficial anaesthesia probably did not influence the findings. Temperature and respiration were altered significantly in all the animals receiving head injuries. Blood gas analysis showed a decrease of standard bicarbonate only after the 1.5 J injury but even though hypoxaemia was not present 2,3-diphosphoglycerate values and P50 increased, compared with the control animals. The fall of plasma lipid concentrations reported probably had to be seen as a sympathomimetic effect of the minor (1.0 J) trauma. Of special significance was the increased activity of malate dehydrogenase and aldolase, found only in the blood of severely traumatized animals, as this could serve as an early diagnostic aid for evaluating head injuries.},

	abstract = {In recent years, wetland restoration measures have created extensive concerns globally. The theory and practice of restoring wetland vegetation diversity in wetlands through soil seed banks is discussed in this paper. A comparative study on soil seed bank and species composition in Yeyahu Wetland, Beijing, was conducted in 2007. Species and quantities of seeds from 12 sample sites were counted and measured by the seed-germinating method. After germination, 27 species belonging to 16 families and 23 genera were recorded, with an average of 11.75 species per sample site, and total average density of 24831.0 individuals/m2. There were significant differences between the soil seed bank and vegetation in spring, summer and autumn, with similarity coefficients of 0.2620 ± 0.0868, 0.2580 ± 0.0778 and 0.1953 ± 0.0452, respectively. Also in 2008, by using the seed bank technique, vegetation diversity was restored in a degraded wetland near Maying River of Yeyahu Wetland through the processes of spot selection, topographic surveying, water level monitoring, and vegetation management. The results showed that in the restored regions, both species and diversity coefficients of vegetation observably increased: 73.68\% of the hydrophytic species we discovered were transplanted from provenance regions; germination of seeds in the soil lasted until late September; and many species completed their life history and produced new seeds to renew the seed bank. In addition, the results suggested that seed bank technique not only increased richness and multiplicity of vegetation, but also provided food chains with animal diversity in wetlands.},

In this study, we present results from a 13-year oligohaline marsh fertilization experiment aimed at determining whether eutrophic conditions compromise ecosystem stability, defined here as the capacity to keep pace with sea level rise and resist the erosive forces of high-energy meteorologic events. To accomplish this objective, we measured soil surface elevation change and soil shear strength, along with a suite of regulatory processes that included belowground standing crop, belowground decomposition, organic and mineral matter accumulation, soil accretion, and shallow subsidence. Our results identified an apparent compensatory effect of nutrient enrichment on accretionary processes whereby shallow subsidence, attributed to reduced live root standing crop, was balanced by enhanced accretion resulting from greater organic matter accumulation at the soil surface. Consequently, the rate of marsh elevation change measured over a five-year period was unaffected after more than a decade of experimental nutrient enrichment. Furthermore, the structural integrity of the soil matrix did not deteriorate under elevated nutrient conditions; decomposition rates were similar to control plots, and although live root standing crop was reduced, the root system was evidently stronger, as soil strength tended to increase rather than decrease after nutrients were provided for 13 years. Our data suggest that enhanced nutrient loading is an unlikely destabilizing mechanism in this coastal marsh and possibly others. However, additional long-term research will be required in a diverse range of habitats and environmental settings before broad-based, general conclusions concerning the effects of nutrient enrichment on coastal wetland stability can be made with a high degree of certainty.},

Low salinity wetlands were preferentially eroded, while higher salinity wetlands remained robust and largely unchanged. Here we highlight geotechnical differences between the soil profiles of high and low salinity regimes, which are controlled by vegetation and result in differential erosion. In low salinity wetlands, a weak zone (shear strength 500–1450 Pa) was observed ∼30 cm below the marsh surface, coinciding with the base of rooting. High salinity wetlands had no such zone (shear strengths {\textgreater} 4500 Pa) and contained deeper rooting. Storm waves during Hurricane Katrina produced shear stresses between 425–3600 Pa, sufficient to cause widespread erosion of the low salinity wetlands. Vegetation in low salinity marshes is subject to shallower rooting and is susceptible to erosion during large magnitude storms; these conditions may be exacerbated by low inorganic sediment content and high nutrient inputs. The dramatic difference in resiliency of fresh versus more saline marshes suggests that the introduction of freshwater to marshes as part of restoration efforts may therefore weaken existing wetlands rendering them vulnerable to hurricanes.},

Moreover, those processes vary substantially across wetlands, so modelling platforms require relevant local data. The low-cost, simple, high-precision rod surface-elevation table–marker horizon ({RSET}-{MH}) method fills this critical data gap, can be paired with spatial data sets and modelling and is financially and technically accessible to every country with coastal wetlands. Yet, {RSET} deployment has been limited to a few regions and purposes.

The authors are scientists who have conducted research on mitigation sites, followed mitigation projects, and/or reviewed literature on the subject. This introductory paper defines mitigation in the regulatory context; identifies ecological issues under four headings relative to our ability to create specific ecosystems at will: predictability, structure and function, limiting factors, and landscape issues; and points out the declining status of wetlands and their nationally recognized value. The subsequent six forum papers are: Simenstad and Thom's long-term performance evaluation of a constructed tidal wetland, Bedford's discussion of hydrologic equivalence for freshwater wetland mitigation, Brinson's advice on reference wetlands, Mitsch and Wilson's reflections on how to improve functioning of mitigation wetlands, Zedler's call for regional mitigation planning in southern California, and Race and Fonseca's long-term perspective on mitigation policy.},

Many deltas are also in a state of environmental degradation, and the Mississippi River Delta ({MRD}) stands out as a particularly iconic example. Plans to restore the {MRD} call for partially diverting the Mississippi River, which should reinitiate natural deltaic land-building processes. While the basic physical underpinnings of river diversions are relatively straightforward, there exists a considerable controversy over whether diversions can and do deliver enough sediment to the coastal zone to build sub-aerial land on restoration-dependent time scales. This controversy was addressed through a study of crevasse-splay dynamics at the West Bay Mississippi River Diversion, the largest diversion in the {MRD} that was specifically constructed for coastal restoration. We found that most sediments were distributed over a 13.5 km area, with the maximum deposition occurring at the seaward end of this field. These results indicate substantial sediment deposition downstream of project boundaries and run counter to simple sedimentary models, which predict that maximum sediment deposition should occur closest to the riverbank. Despite this, most sediments appear to be retained in the nearshore zone, suggesting that the sediment retention efficiency was at the higher end of the 30–70\% range suggested by some sediment budgets.},

	abstract = {(1) The effect of feeding a relatively low-protein diet containing 0.06\% {DAB} for 29 weeks on the activity of {DAB}-azoreductase, nitroreductase (p-nitrobenzoic acid), N-oxidase (N,N-dimethylaniline), N-demethylase ({DAB}), cytochrome P-450, {NADPH}-cytochrome c reductase, beta-glucuronidase and arylsulphatase A were studied. Rapid decreases occurred in the activities of the first six enzymes, reaching minimal values at between 4 and 8 weeks. Activities then increased in all cases to control or nearly control levels. This rate of increase was least for cytochrome P-450. At 4 weeks azoreductase activity with the chemotherapeutic agent {CB}10-252 (I) as substrate was significantly higher than in control rats. Early increases occurred in the activities of beta-glucuronidase and arylsulphatase A and the activity of the latter never dropped below the control level. (2) An investigation was made of the differential effects of dye feeding on some of the enzyme activities in the two major liver lobes and differences were found. (3) The effect of phenobarbital ({PB}) pretreatment on the {DAB}-fed rats was studied at 4-week intervals. The activities of {DAB}-azoreductase and of nitroreductase increased throughout the whole period, while the activities of the lysosomal enzymes were decreased. (4) After feeding {DAB} for 4 weeks the effect of {PB} and 3-methylcholanthrene ({MC}) on the activities of {DAB}-azoreductase, {CB}10-252-azoreductase and components of the azoreductases-cytochrome P-450, {NADPH}-cytochrome c reductase, the {CO}-{CB}10-252-azoreductase was not induced by {PB} or {MC}, and {CO} did not inhibit its reduction. Its reduction depended only slightly on {NADH}. {CO} caused a greater relative decrease in the activity of {DAB}-azoreductase in dye-fed animals and also in animals following {PB} and {MC} pretreatment, implying a greater role of cytochrome P-450 in dye-fed animals.},

We investigated the potential for an organic carbon sediment amendment, alginate, to enhance establishment and growth of Spartina alterniflora transplants, as well as colonization by macroinvertebrates commonly associated with S. alterniflora (Uca sp. and Littoraria irrorata). Plots were established in a bare mud area previously inhabited by S. alterniflora, and transplant rhizospheres were either treated with alginate or left unamended as controls. Growth of transplanted S. alterniflora and colonization by Uca sp. and L. irrorata were evaluated over portions of three growing seasons. Within the first month post-transplantation, a nonsignificant trend toward greater live stem density emerged, but disappeared completely by week ten. Both Uca sp. and L. irrorata densities were significantly greater in the alginate treatment compared to the control only during the first ten weeks post-transplantation. However, the initial organic content of the sediment in the transplant area was more than twice that in the adjacent natural marsh. Therefore, our findings suggest that a threshold level of sediment organic matter above which alginate addition does not confer an advantage on transplanted S. alterniflora may exist, and the conditions under which amendments are most beneficial to transplanted S. alterniflora should be determined.},

Sludge disposal is currently limited to terrestrial conditions due to concern for the transmission of pollutants. Wetland structure and wetland biogeochemical cycles were compared with sludge disposal practices to identify strengths and weaknesses in wetland mechanisms for pollution control. Potential pollution from sludge use is proposed to be mitigated both by wetland function and by the substrate construction method. Because {MSS} requires specific handling techniques to prevent undesired release into the environment, to protect workers and to be practical for construction, designs responsive to the nature of the construction material were necessary. Three designs were developed, evaluated and compared in terms of aesthetics, educational opportunities, environmental safety, nutrient cycling, waste material utilization, substrate construction requirements and wetland establishment requirements.},

This study compared the soil characteristics of sediment- amended coastal swamps in the Barataria Preserve unit of Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve with natural swamps along Bayou des Familles. The sandy sediment amendments used in the coastal forests had different soil texture and characteristics than the more organic soils of the natural swamps. Three years after the application of these sediments on the sediment-amended swamps, dewatering and compaction of the sediment had occurred but the sediment still had high salinity and bulk density, and low organic matter content. The two sediment-amended swamps differed from each other in that Site 1 had a higher elevation (mean = 25 cm higher) and drier soil than Site 2. The effects of sediment in coastal forested wetlands require separate consideration from studies of salt marshes, e.g., the weight of the sediment might damage tree roots, or the amendments might influence soil stability during storms in a different way. Generally, this study suggests that shallower depths of sediment are more likely to yield environments beneficial to these sinking baldcypress swamps in coastal Louisiana.},

Efforts to restore these deteriorated wetlands often include some form of sediment addition for successful rehabilitation. The earthen materials generated during petrochemical exploration (drill cuttings) may prove to be an ancillary sediment source for restoration efforts, while also reducing the load of oil-field waste. This study assessed two differently processed drill cuttings ({DC}-A and {DC}-B), dredge spoil and topsoil (control) in conjunction with three hydrologic regimes and five vegetative conditions (Spartina alterniflora, Spartina patens, Spartina cynosuroides, Avicennia germinans, and an unvegetated control) at four salinity levels to determine sediment characteristics and capacity for supporting wetland plant growth.

The {DC}-A and the dredge treatments demonstrated similar soil physico-chemical characteristics, which fell within acceptable ranges, and were comparable to the control in supporting plant growth. {DC}-B under fresh conditions demonstrated a high interstitial {pH} (∼11.0) that became ameliorated (∼8.3) under all saline conditions. Plant photosynthetic response was minimal in {DC}-B under fresh conditions, but comparable to the control under saline conditions. These results are promising and warrant further evaluations under a wider range of environmental conditions prior to field implementation.},

	abstract = {We collected sediment cores from three salt marsh ponds in coastal Louisiana to test the usefulness of proxies of eutrophication. One-centimeter increments of 210Pb- and 137Cs-dated sediment were analyzed for diatoms, pigments (phaeophytin and chlorophyll a), biogenic silica, percentage organic matter, percentage carbon, and percentage nitrogen. Both sediment chlorophyll a and a diatom-based trophic index ({TI}) were significantly and positively correlated with riverine or local nutrient indices. Two diatom species, Amphora copulata Giffen and Navicula yarrensis Grunow, were significantly and negatively correlated with riverine and local nutrient indices. These results suggest that these variables can be used as potential indicators of trophic status. Results from a complete-linkage cluster analysis on the diatom assemblage data demonstrated that the sediment cores could be split into three time periods: early 1900s (pre-1930s/1940s), mid-1900s (1930s/40s to 1960s/1970s), and late 1900s (1960s/70s to 1990s). Examination of the sediment chlorophyll a and {TI} data over these time periods, coupled with an analysis of variance of nutrient inputs between the time periods, suggests that nutrient loading increased dramatically from the mid- 1960s to the mid-1970s. This study demonstrates that (1) a retrospective analysis of sediment cores can be conducted in highly variable salt marsh ponds and (2) these salt marsh environments are already affected by the higher nutrient loads from both riverine and local processes occurring over the last 50 years. Additional nutrient loading, e.g., from river diversion projects for the lower Mississippi River, may exacerbate eutrophication already evident in the marsh environment.},

Marsh soil accretion processes were examined at 12 locations in fresh and brackish marshes in Louisiana's northern Barataria Basin estuary. Soil accretion rate determined from 137Cs ranged from 0.59 to 1.03 cm yr− 1. Soil structure and accretion were controlled primarily by organic matter accumulation rather than mineral sediment deposition with water and entrapped gases occupying the majority of the soil volume ranging from 92 to 95\%. Organic matter accumulation ranged from 328 to 580 g m− 2 yr− 1 while mineral accumulation ranged from 78 to 380 g m− 2 yr− 1 Such organic-based fresh and brackish marsh soil are more fragile than mineral based marsh soils and are subject to impact by salt water intrusion and hurricane storm surge forces. The Davis Pond diversion is a conduit between the Mississippi River and the coastal marshes of Barataria basin currently reintroducing river water into the basin leading to lower basin salinities This hydrologic management measure should benefit and extend the stability of the studied marsh sites encouraging continued vegetation growth and soil organic matter accumulation. Accrual of organic matter is necessary to prevent drowning of the marsh which is subject to both the global eustatic sea level rise (1–2 mm yr− 1) and significant local subsidence ({\textasciitilde} 10 mm yr− 1). This high rate of relative sea level rise can lead to open water/ponding and subsequent erosion of the surrounding marsh due to flooding and salinity stress.},

	abstract = {We applied sediment slurries of varying thicknesses to deteriorating vegetated brackish marsh areas with organic soils. Our objective was to determine if overall elevation change and its component processes of soil compression and sediment consolidation are differentially affected by different amounts of sediment and to assess sediment effects on key ecosystem functions and physico-chemical drivers. We found that sediment nourishment (2.3–20.3 cm) increased soil surface elevation initially, but by the end of the ∼2.5 year study period, sediment-nourished areas, averaged over all thicknesses, subsided to pre-sediment surface elevations, and were no different from reference area surface elevations. Rates of elevation change, soil compression, and sediment consolidation were all strongly related to applied sediment thickness; plots that received more sediment lost elevation at faster rates. Elevation change following sediment nourishment was driven by soil compression that occurred within the underlying native soil. In contrast, applied sediment consolidation over time had little negative influence on elevation change, though applied sediment bulk density increased linearly with increasing sediment thickness. Sediment nourishment \&lt;10 cm thick resulted in plots having lower elevations (up to ∼2 cm lower) compared to pre-sediment conditions without enhanced function. However, plots that received \&gt;15 cm of sediment nourishment had both small elevation gains (\&lt;3 cm) compared to pre-sediment surface elevations and greater plant production compared to unamended reference plots. Factors influencing enhanced ecosystem function included a combination of greater soil bulk density, mineral matter content, available nutrient and trace metal concentrations, higher soil redox potential, and reduced salinity and sulfide stress that occurred with increasing sediment nourishment.},

In this article, we outline a possible sustainability strategy that incorporates the natural degree of substrate instability on these sedimentary landscapes.

The application rates were such that 0, 66, 132, or 265 mg total N kg−1 were added with the biosolids (total C and N content 158 and 11.5 g kg−1 dry biosolids, respectively). Approximately 60\% of the biosolids were mineralized within 90 days. Microbial respiration and to a lesser extent ammonification and nitrification, increased after biosolids application. The {rRNA} intergenic spacer analysis ({RISA}) patterns for the biosolids and unamended soil bacterial communities were different, indicating that the microorganisms in the biosolids were distinct from the native population. It appears that the survival of the allochthonous microorganisms was short, presumably due to the adverse soil conditions.},

	abstract = {Vegetation along a coastline could offer significant protection of the adjoining land area against natural hazards such as storm surge and tsunami. In this context, the flexibility of the individual that stems within the green belt is understood to play an important role in the attenuation of momentum of the incoming waves. The physics of which, is yet to be understood completely. Difficulty in modeling the rigidity of the plantations, both numerically and experimentally, is the main cause for this lack of understanding. In the present work, a detailed laboratory study is taken up to examine the resistance characteristics of a group of model slender flexible cylinders. The individual cylinders of the group were fixed to the bed in a staggered configuration. The size, vegetation density and the elastic modulus of the individual stems were chosen such that the tests covered the practical ranges of vegetation in coastal forestry. The Manning's n for different flow conditions as well as for vegetative parameters was obtained from the physical tests in uniform steady current. The results clearly bring out the variation of flow resistance in terms of flow velocity, density of plantation, individual stem diameter and its elastic property. A new empirical relationship is proposed for estimation of Manning's n for staggered flexible emerging plantations which is valid for depths of flow greater than 0.8 times the undeflected plant height.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic models are used to simulate the hurricane-induced storm surge and coastal inundation in regions with vegetation. Typically, 2D storm surge models use an enhanced Manning coefficient while 3D storm surge models use a roughness height to represent the effects of coastal vegetation on flow. This paper presents a 3D storm surge model which accurately resolves the effects of vegetation on the flow and turbulence. First, a vegetation-resolving 1DV Turbulent Kinetic Energy model ({TKEM}) is introduced and validated with laboratory data. This model is both robust enough to accurately model flows in complex canopies, while compact and efficient enough for incorporation into a 3D storm surge-wave modeling system: Curvilinear Hydrodynamics in 3D-Surface {WAves} Nearshore ({CH}3D-{SWAN}). Using the 3D vegetation-resolving model, three numerical experiments are conducted. In the first experiment, comparisons are made between the 2D Manning coefficient approach and the 3D vegetation-resolving approach for simple wind-driven flow. In a second experiment, 2D and 3D representations of vegetation produce similar inundations from the same hurricane forcing, but differences in momentum are found. In a final experiment, varying inundation between seemingly analogous 2D and 3D representations of vegetation are demonstrated, pointing to a significant scientific need for data within wetlands during storm surge events. This study shows that the complex flow structures within vegetation canopies can be accurately simulated using a vegetation-resolving 3D storm surge model, which can be used to assess the feasibility for future wetland restoration projects.},

It turns out that the S. anglica root system is more effective in reducing lateral cliff erosion than the root system of L. vulgare. Also the establishment of S. anglica by germination of seeds is studied in relation to the erosion/deposition rates at an accretion site in the Krabbenkreek. The percentage of seeds washed away depends on the mobility of the superficial sediment which increases with decreasing height above N.A.P. (Dutch Ordnance Level). Above 0.90 m + N.A.P. a germination of 20\% is measured, but seedlings survive the winter period only in the zone where a patchy vegetation already exists.

	abstract = {Wetland hydrology is a critical component to the success of mitigation projects. The alteration of soil hydraulic properties during the construction may influence the hydrology of the wetland, thus affecting the mitigation success. We studied disturbed (i.e. by construction) and nondisturbed areas of two wetland mitigation banks (Blackjack, {BJ} and Peters Farm, {PF}), both located in the piedmont region of Virginia, for a variety of soil hydraulic and physicochemical properties. The surface soil horizon at {BJ} showed an increase in clay content from 18.6 to 40\%, decrease in bulk density (Db) from 1.56 to 1.45 g/cm3, decrease the drained volume (Dv) of water in the soil profile from 0.67 to 0.36 cm, decrease in available water content ({AWC}) from 22.7 to 15.8\%, and a reduction in the ratio of {AWC} to {TPS} from 66 to 40\%. Soil at {PF} showed an increase in clay content in the surface horizon from 20 to 30\%, increase {TPS} from 37.2 to 40.0\%, increase Db from 1.52 to 1.67 g/cm3, increase the Dv in the soil profile from 3.5 to 6.6 cm, increase in {AWC} from 37.2 to 40.2\%, and a decrease in the ratio of {AWC} to {TPS} from 58 to 44\% in the surface horizon. The outcome showed that the impacts of common construction practices for mitigation wetlands affected drainable and plant available subsurface water storage, more so in fine grained soils. Key soil hydraulic properties should be considered in the disturbed or ameliorated state before water budgets are constructed to model wetland hydrology. Further studies are needed to investigate how the plant available and drainable water contents can be affected by construction practices in various soil textures, and how these properties might change in the long term.},

	abstract = {Sediment dynamics have an important influence on the morphological evolution of tidal wetlands, which consist of mudflats and salt marshes. To understand the nature of sediment behavior under combined current–wave action at an exposed tidal wetland, we measured the waves, currents, water depths, bed-level changes, and sediment properties at a mudflat–salt marsh transition on the Yangtze Delta, China, during five consecutive tides under onshore winds of {\textasciitilde} 8 m/s, and calculated the bed shear stresses due to currents (τc), waves (τw), combined current–wave action (τcw), and the critical shear stress for erosion of the bottom sediment (τce). The bed shear stresses under combined current–wave action (τcw) were approximately five times higher on the mudflat (up to 1.11 N/m2; average 0.27 N/m2) than on the salt marsh (up to 0.14 N/m2; average, 0.06 N/m2). On the mudflat, τcw was larger than the critical erosion shear stress (τce = 0.103 N/m2) for 70\% of the period of submergence, whereas τcw was always lower than τce at the salt marsh site (τce = 0.116 N/m2). This result indicates that the sediment dynamics on the mudflat were dominated by erosion, whereas at the salt marsh they were governed by deposition, which is in agreement with the observed bed-level change during the study period (− 3.3 mm/tide on the mudflat and 3.0 mm/tide on the salt marsh). A comparison of τcw values calculated using the van Rijn (1993) and Soulsby (1995) models for bed shear stresses under combined current–wave action indicates that both models are applicable to the present case and effectively predict the bottom shear stress under combined current–wave action. Overall, we conclude that τcw in combination with τce is useful in assessing the hydrodynamic mechanisms that underlie the morphological evolution of exposed tidal wetlands.},

In fact, practical experiences show that restoration designs based entirely on hydrologic assessment may not result in optimal recovery of marsh habitat, ecological functions, or estuarine biodiversity. As Zedler (2000, 402) noted in a review of wetland restoration progress, “it takes more than water to restore a wetland.” It is not possible to anticipate long-term habitat responses without also considering a myriad of interrelated ecological factors. Inability to account for complex ecological interactions, even if tidal exchange is restored, may lead to unintended and less than optimal results when measured against management goals of recovering specific acreage of salt marsh habitat and controlling invasive species.},

We find that water quality improvement, nonconsumptive recreation, and provision of natural habitat and biodiversity are highly valued services. Substitution effects are observed through the negative correlation between values and abundance of other wetlands. Wetland values are found to increase with anthropogenic pressure. An extended metaregression model with cross effects shows that the valuation of specific services varies with the type of wetland producing them.

	abstract = {To date, flow through submerged aquatic vegetation has largely been viewed as perturbed boundary layer flow, with vegetative drag treated as an extension of bed drag. However, recent studies of terrestrial canopies demonstrate that the flow structure within and just above an unconfined canopy more strongly resembles a mixing layer than a boundary layer. This paper presents laboratory measurements, obtained from a scaled seagrass model, that demonstrate the applicability of the mixing layer analogy to aquatic systems. Specifically, all vertical profiles of mean velocity contained an inflection point, which makes the flow susceptible to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. This instability leads to the generation of large, coherent vortices within the mixing layer (observed in the model at frequencies between 0.01 and 0.11 Hz), which dominate the vertical transport of momentum through the layer. The downstream advection of these vortices is shown to cause the progressive, coherent waving of aquatic vegetation, known as the monami. When the monami is present, the turbulent vertical transport of momentum is enhanced, with turbulent stresses penetrating an additional 30\% of the plant height into the canopy.},

Critical shear stress was measured as a proxy for soil stabilization using a Cohesive Strength Meter in three parallel wetlands. Despite efforts to create three replicate wetlands by uniform construction and identical planting, each developed a distinct hydroperiod (low, intermediate, and high water-recession rates) and vegetation (varied biomass of cattails [Typha species]). Critical shear stress (τc) was highest in the high-recession, fast-draining wetland (7.8 Pa), followed by the intermediate-recession swale (6.1 Pa) and the low-recession, inundated swale (4.1 Pa). These values correlated with differential development of moss and algal mats, both of which were highly resistant to erosion (τc of 8.6 and 7.4 Pa, respectively). These epibenthic mats were patchy and developed primarily in the wetlands with high and intermediate water-recession rates but were limited in the low-recession wetland, with cattail shade, anaerobic conditions, and substrates consisting of organic matter (τc of 5.6 Pa), bare soil (3.0 Pa), and muck (1.8 Pa). Small inflows sustained ponding and associated cattails, which promoted shade and destabilized the surface soil of the low-recession system, as well as subareas within the better-drained wetlands. Epibenthic mats played an unexpected, disproportionate role in soil stabilization compared to vascular plants.},

Many questions remain, however, regarding the role of microbial communities in rhizospheric soil. In this study, we used metagenomic analysis to assess microbial community composition and function in a constructed wetland receiving surface water. The diversity of the microbial community of rhizosphere soil was found to be significantly greater than that of the wetland influent water. This enhancement is likely due to the availability of diverse habitats and nutrients provided by the wetland plants. From function annotation of metagenomic data, a number of biodegradation pathways associated with 14 xenobiotic compounds were identified in soil. Nitrogen fixation, nitrification and denitrification genes were semi-quantitatively analyzed. By screening of manganese transformation genes, we found that the biological oxidation of Mn2+ (mainly catalyzed by multicopper oxidase) in the influent water yielded insoluble Mn4+, which subsequently precipitated and were incorporated into the wetland soil. These data show that the use of metagenomic analysis can provide important new insights for the study of wetland ecosystems and, in particular, how biologically-mediated transformation or degradation can be used to reduce contamination of point and non-point source wastewater.},

Mitigation projects should be evaluated based on ‘compliance’ of specific mitigation criteria. Peer-reviewed assessments of wetland restoration projects have focused on appropriate parameters (topographic, hydrologic, soil, vegetation, and animal components); however, for the most part, they have evaluated small, newly restored wetlands over the short-term with little repeated sampling. Future assessments should focus on understanding problems at a particular site by identifying cause–effect mechanisms. We review a case study from San Diego Bay where detailed assessments led to the identification of problems and subsequent management alternatives. We also recommend the use of two novel approaches: experimentation and the evaluation of ecosystem resiliency to unplanned disturbances. These assessments will provide a better understanding of ecosystem functioning and enhance current comparisons of natural and restored systems. A stronger science base for wetland restoration and adaptive management do not guarantee that restoration targets will be reached; however, these approaches will identify the causes of problems and allow us to predict whether or not restoration targets can be reached in a timely manner.},

	abstract = {Twelve salt marshes in south Louisiana ({USA}) were classified as either ‘impaired’ or ‘healthy’ before a summer sample collection of above- and below-ground biomass and determination of sediment accretion rates. The above-ground biomass of plant tissues was the same at both impaired and healthy salt marshes and was not a good predictor of marsh health. However, below-ground root biomass in the upper 30 cm was much lower in the impaired marshes compared to the healthy marshes. Compromises to root production apparently occur before there is an obvious consequence to the above-ground biomass, which may quickly collapse before remedial action can be taken. The subsequent change in vertical position of the marsh surface may be equivalent to many years of accretion, and be irreversible within decades without considerable effort. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that it is the plant's below-ground accumulation of organic matter, not inorganic matter that governs the maintenance of salt marsh ecosystem in the vertical plane. Reversing the precursor conditions leading to marsh stress before the collapse of the above-ground biomass occurs is therefore a prudent management objective and could be easier than restoration.},

	abstract = {In deltaic marshes, mineral sediment promotes positive elevation change and counters subsidence and sea level rise. In many such marshes sediment deficits result in wetland loss. One new way to address sediment deficiency is to supply marshes with sediments in a slurry that deposits the sediment in a thin layer over a large area. The long-term effects of this strategy are poorly understood. In a rapidly submerging,Spartina alterniflora salt marsh, we tested how different amounts of sediment ameliorated the effects of sea level rise and subsidence over 7 yr (1992–1998). Sediment slurry enrichment likely affected plants and soils by two mechanisms. It increased elevation and soil bulk density, leading to increased plant vigor and soil condition. These effects were long lasting, such that by 1998 areas receiving moderate amounts of sediment (5–12 cm relative elevation) had better plant vigor and soil condition compared to areas not receiving sediment (55\% cover versus 20\%; bulk densities of 0.4–1.0 g cm−3 versus 0.2 g cm−3; 0 {mM} hydrogen sulfide versus {\textgreater} 1.0 {mM}). The sediment slurry also had high nutrient content, which resulted in a pulse of growth, especially in areas receiving the most sediment (areas {\textgreater} 12 cm relative elevation initially had {\textgreater}90\% cover and canopy heights {\textgreater}1.6 m). This nutrient-induced growth spurt was short lived and faded after 3 yr, at which point the long lasting effects of increased elevation probably became the dominant factor promoting plant vigor and soil condition. Moderate levels of sediment generated the most beneficial and long lasting effects to the vegetation and soils. This degree of sediment slurry addition countered the effects of subsidence and sea level rise, but not so much as to surpass the intertidal position to {whichS}. alterniflora is best adapted.},

	abstract = {Impacts of global climate change, such as sea level rise and severe drought, have altered the hydrology of coastal salt marshes resulting in submergence and subsequent degradation of ecosystem function. A potential method of rehabilitating these systems is the addition of sediment-slurries to increase marsh surface elevation, thus ameliorating effects of excessive inundation. Although this technique is growing in popularity, the restoration of ecological function after sediment addition has received little attention. To determine if sediment subsidized salt marshes are functionally equivalent to natural marshes, we examined above- and belowground primary production in replicated restored marshes receiving four levels of sediment addition (29–42 cm North American Vertical Datum of 1988 [{NAVD} 88]) and in degraded and natural ambient marshes (4–22 cm {NAVD} 88). Moderate intensities of sediment-slurry addition, resulting in elevations at the mid to high intertidal zone (29–36 cm {NAVD} 88), restored ecological function to degraded salt marshes. Sediment additions significantly decreased flood duration and frequency and increased bulk density, resulting in greater soil drainage and redox potential and significantly lower phytotoxic sulfide concentrations. However, ecological function in the restored salt marsh showed a sediment addition threshold that was characterized by a decline in primary productivity in areas of excessive sediment addition and high elevation ({\textgreater}36 cm {NAVD} 88). Hence, the addition of intermediate levels of sediment to submerging salt marshes increased marsh surface elevation, ameliorated impacts of prolonged inundation, and increased primary productivity. However, too much sediment resulted in diminished ecological function that was equivalent to the submerged or degraded system.},

Restoration scientists and practitioners are now on the frontline and will be increasingly called upon to get involved in large scale programs addressing immediate environmental crises and challenges. Here, we summarize the advances in mainstreaming ecological restoration in global environmental policy deliberations during the last year, culminating in the recent meeting of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. We also provide key references for those seeking more information, and set out an agenda as to how the restoration community could respond to and act upon these recent developments. However, we underline the need for caution and prudence; we must not promise more than we can deliver. Thirty years after the emergence of ecological restoration as a scientific discipline and practice, there remain many obstacles and misconceptions about what can be achieved at large scales. Yet, clearly the old adage applies here: nothing ventured, nothing gained.},

	abstract = {The salt marsh grass Spartina anglica is an important habitat-modifying ecosystem engineering agent that facilitates large-scale salt marsh formation by enhancing sediment accretion. It dominates many European tidal environments and is invasive in many other parts of the world. We question (1) to what extent the ecosystem engineering ability of patchy Spartina vegetation depends on large-scale abiotic processes, and (2) whether tussock shape provides an indicator for future lateral salt marsh development. Analysing the topography of 83 individual tussocks in contrasting environments revealed that there are 6 clearly distinguishable tussock shapes, and that the classical example of a sediment-accumulating dome-shaped tussock only occurs under a limited set of abiotic conditions. The outcome of habitat modification by S. anglica is shown to be conditional, depending on large-scale morphodynamics and sediment grain size. Resulting tussock shape provides a clear indication for the long-term development of the pioneer zone. Understanding of the conditional outcome of ecosystem engineering is highly relevant in this era of climate change and ongoing anthropogenic influences on coastal ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Although the concept of ecosystem sustainability has a long-term focus, it is often viewed from a static system perspective. Because most ecosystems are dynamic, we explore sustainability assessments from three additional perspectives: resilient systems; systems where tipping points occur; and systems subject to episodic resetting. Whereas foundations of ecosystem resilience originated in ecology, recent discussions have focused on geophysical attributes, and it is recognized that dynamic system components may not return to their former state following perturbations. Tipping points emerge when chronic changes (typically anthropogenic, but sometimes natural) push ecosystems to thresholds that cause collapse of process and function and may become permanent. Ecosystem resetting occurs when episodic natural disasters breach thresholds with little or no warning, resulting in long-term changes to environmental attributes or ecosystem function. An example of sustainability assessment of ecosystem goods and services along the Gulf Coast ({USA}) demonstrates the need to include both the resilient and dynamic nature of biogeomorphic components. Mountain road development in northwest Yunnan, China, makes rivers and related habitat vulnerable to tipping points. Ecosystems reset by natural disasters are also presented, emphasizing the need to understand the magnitude frequency and interrelationships among major disturbances, as shown by (i) the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and resulting tsunami, including how unsustainable urban development exacerbates geodisaster propagation, and (ii) repeated major earthquakes and associated geomorphic and vegetation disturbances in Papua New Guinea. Although all of these ecosystem perturbations and shifts are individually recognized, they are not embraced in contemporary sustainable decision making.},

	abstract = {Meandering rivers are common on Earth and other planetary surfaces, yet the conditions necessary to maintain meandering channels are unclear. As a consequence, self-maintaining meandering channels with cutoffs have not been reproduced in the laboratory. Such experimental channels are needed to explore mechanisms controlling migration rate, sinuosity, floodplain formation, and planform morphodynamics and to test theories for wavelength and bend propagation. Here we report an experiment in which meandering with near-constant width was maintained during repeated cutoff and regeneration of meander bends. We found that elevated bank strength (provided by alfalfa sprouts) relative to the cohesionless bed material and the blocking of troughs (chutes) in the lee of point bars via suspended sediment deposition were the necessary ingredients to successful meandering. Varying flood discharge was not necessary. Scaling analysis shows that the experimental meander migration was fast compared to most natural channels. This high migration rate caused nearly all of the bedload sediment to exchange laterally, such that bar growth was primarily dependent on bank sediment supplied from upstream lateral migration. The high migration rate may have contributed to the relatively low sinuosity of 1.19, and this suggests that to obtain much higher sinuosity experiments at this scale may have to be conducted for several years. Although patience is required to evolve them, these experimental channels offer the opportunity to explore several fundamental issues about river morphodynamics. Our results also suggest that sand supply may be an essential control in restoring self-maintaining, actively shifting gravel-bedded meanders.},

	url = {http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/5j76502x},
	abstract = {The stability of levees in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is threatened by continued subsidence of Delta peat islands. Up to 6 meters of land-surface elevation has been lost in the 150 years since Delta marshes were leveed and drained, primarily from oxidation of peat soils. Flooding subsided peat islands halts peat oxidation by creating anoxic soils, but net accumulation of new material in restored wetlands is required to recover land-surface elevations.  We investigated the subsidence reversal potential of two 3 hectare, permanently flooded, impounded wetlands re-established on a deeply subsided field on Twitchell Island. The shallower wetland (design water depth 25 cm) was almost completely colonized by dense emergent marsh vegetation within two years; whereas, the deeper wetland (design water depth 55 cm) which developed spatially variable depths as a result of  heterogeneous colonization by emergent vegetation, still had some areas remaining as open water after nine years. Changes in land-surface elevation were quantified using repeated sedimentation-erosion table measurements. New material accumulating in the wetlands was sampled by coring.       Land-surface elevations increased by an average of 4 cm/yr in both wetlands from 1997 to 2006; however, the rates at different sites in the wetlands ranged from -0.5 to +9.2 cm/yr.  Open water areas of the deeper wetland without emergent vegetation had the lowest rates of land-surface elevation gain. The greatest rates occurred in areas of the deeper wetland most isolated from the river water inlets, with dense stands of emergent marsh vegetation (tules and cattails). Vegetated areas of the deeper wetland in the transition zones between open water and mature emergent stands had intermediate rates of land-surface gain, as did the entire shallower wetland. These results suggest that the dominant component contributing to land-surface elevation gain in these wetlands was accumulation of organic matter, rather than mineral sediment, and that accumulation of organic matter in emergent marshes is strongly affected by hydrologic factors. Re-established, non-tidal wetlands with managed hydrology can produce significant increases in land-surface elevations, which can help to improve levee stability and protect subsided islands from future flooding.},

	abstract = {The main objective of this study was to observe the sludge accumulation pattern of an experimental, covered, anaerobic pond treating municipal wastewater under Mediterranean climatic conditions throughout a 2-year operational period (1999–2000) in order to form a seasonal sludge accumulation model which may be used to predict the required desludging time, not only of the particular anaerobic pond used in the study, but also for other types of anaerobic ponds and operational situations. The 4-m deep pond was supplied with pre-screened, untreated wastewater from the nearby treatment plant of Thessaloniki, Greece, initially at a flow rate of 120 m3/day and later at a flow rate of 150 m3/day. The influent characteristics were {BOD}5 441 mg O2/L, {COD} 942 mg O2/L and suspended solids ({SS}) 574 mg/L. {BOD}5, {COD}, and {SS} concentrations of the pond effluent were reduced by 50\%, 53\%, and 64\%, respectively, in comparison with those of the influent. During the operational period, three distinctly different zones were seen to form within the anaerobic pond: The first zone, which formed at the bottom of the pond, consisted of inert, high-density sludge. The second zone, which formed above this, contained a high concentration of volatile (easily biodegradable) sludge. The third upper zone (supernatant), was a liquid layer low in suspended solids. The accumulation of sludge in the pond followed an annual sinusoidal pattern with high values during winter and low ones during summer due to the increased digestion rate. The maximum high-density sludge height observed was 0.7 m, or 2\% (14 m3) of the total pond volume. The maximum volatile sludge accumulation reached 3.1 m, or 53\% (300 m3) of the pond volume. A seasonal sludge accumulation model, based on the sludge inflow and seasonal digestion rates, was used to simulate the annual fluctuation in accumulation rate for the local (Mediterranean type) climatic conditions. Monthly values of accumulation (or digestion) rate of sludge ({KAS}) were experimentally estimated at specific mean monthly air temperatures and approximated by a regression second degree polynomial equation to be used with the model. The predicted desludging interval for our experimental pond was 3 years.},

A wetland, converted to agriculture in the mid-1970s, was restored to re-establish a non-riverine wet hardwood forest community in eastern North Carolina. Three surface techniques were implemented during construction to determine their effect on successfully restoring target wetland hydrology. The surface treatments, replicated within a randomized complete block design, were: plugging field ditches without altering the land surface ({PLUG}), plugging the field ditches and roughening the surface ({ROUGH}), and plugging the field ditches and removing the field crown ({CR}). Hydrologic conditions for the restoration and a nearby reference site were evaluated based on three years of monitoring data. Daily water table depths between the restoration and reference were within 11 cm on average. An initial evaluation found inconsistencies of treatment effect between blocks, and an as-built survey later confirmed surface elevations within Block 3 deviated from the intended design and was excluded from further analysis. Water table and outflow conditions for the remaining treatment plots and the reference were evaluated using several hydrologic criteria. The {CR} treatment was found to produce the wettest surface conditions and exported the lowest volume of outflow. For the majority of criterion considered, {CR} also produced significantly wetter conditions than the reference. The {PLUG} and {ROUGH} treatments produced similar hydrologic conditions and tracked closely with the median hydrologic conditions in the reference. Based on the results of this study and several others in low lying coastal areas, plugging pre-existing field ditches may be adequate to restore jurisdictional wetland hydrology and match reference hydrologic conditions. However, surface roughening is low cost method to increase surface storage and introduce microtopographic diversity. For many areas, the removal of existing field crown may be cost-prohibitive and produce wetter than desired conditions. Crown removal should be reserved for sites which have borderline historic wetland hydrologic characteristics.},

Data documenting the interactions of Spartina alterniflora, represented by polyolefin tubing, and single- and double-peaked irregular waves were collected in a large-scale laboratory flume. The laboratory provided a controlled environment to evaluate wave attenuation, including the parameters of stem density, submergence, wave height, and peak period. Wave attenuation appeared to be most dependent on stem density and the ratio of stem length to water depth. Wave attention increased slightly with wave height while no clear trend with respect to wave period was seen. Treating double-peaked spectra as superimposed wave systems revealed a preferential dissipation of the higher-frequency wave system relative to the lower-frequency wave system under emergent conditions. Wave energy loss occurred at all frequencies of both spectral types, with dissipation increasing with frequency above the spectral peak. Parameterizing the spectral equilibrium range as a function of frequency showed a steepening of the spectral tail compared to the − 4 power law under emergent conditions. An empirical relationship defining the bulk drag coefficient for S. alterniflora as a function of the stem Reynolds number is found to serve as a first estimate for engineering applications.},

The giant reed has slightly tapered hollow stems (4–6 m high) with flat leaves and an extensive underground rhizomatous system with solid branches bearing adventitious roots. Quantitative analyses of videorecordings prove that A. donax responds to dynamic deflections of the stem with damped harmonic bending oscillations. The logarithmic decrement can be used to calculate the relative damping, as a measure of the plant's capacity to dissipate vibrational energy. Plants with leaves have a significantly higher damping compared to plants without leaves. A comparison of the relative damping of plants with and without leaves shows that this finding is only partly due to aerodynamic resistance of the leaves. Structural damping also contributes considerably to the overall damping of the foliate A. donax stem. By stepwise removal of the underground plant organs the influence of rhizome, roots, and soil on the vibrational behavior was determined. The data indicate that underground plant organs as well as leaf sheaths covering the nodes have no significant influence on damping.},

	abstract = {Results from multi-year investigations in the San Francisco Bay estuary show that large abundance fluctuations within benthic macroinvertebrate populations reflect both (1) within-year periodicity of reproduction, recruitment, and mortality that is not necessarily coincident with seasonal changes of the environment (e.g., the annual temperature cycle), and (2) aperiodic density changes (often larger than within-year fluctuations) following random perturbations of the environment. Density peaks of the small, short-lived estuarine invertebrates that comprise the vast majority of individuals in the bay’s relatively homogeneous benthic community normally occur between spring and autumn depending on the species, in large part a reflection of reproductive periodicity. However, because mild winters permit reproductive activity in some of the common species throughout much of the year, other factors are important to within-year density fluctuations in the community. Seasonally predictable changes in freshwater inflow, wind and tidal mixing, microalgal biomass, and sediment erosion/ deposition patterns all contribute to observed seasonal changes in abundance. For example, the commonly’ observed decline in abundance during winter reflects both short-lived species that die after reproducing and the stress of winter conditions (e.g., inundation by less saline, sediment-laden water and the decline in both planktonic and benthic algal biomass — a direct source of food for the shallow-water benthos). On the other hand, data from several studies suggest that observed ‘recruitment’ and ‘mortality’ may in fact be the migration of juveniles and adults to and from study sites. For example, the common amphipod Ampelisca abdita apparently moves from shallow to deep water, or from up-estuary to down-estuary locations, coincident with periods of high river runoff in winter. Growth of individuals within the few studied species populations is also highly seasonal, and appears to be coincident with seasonal increases in the abundance of planktonic and/ or benthic microalgae. Two multi-year studies have shown that, in addition to within-year periodicity, major restructuring of the benthic community can occur as a result of anomalous (usually climate-related) perturbations of the benthic habitat. For example, during wet years freshwater-intolerant species disappear from the upper part of the estuary and from shallow areas of the bay. During a two-year drought these same species colonized the extreme upper end of the estuary in large numbers. Other aperiodic perturbations include localized instances of sediment erosion or deposition and algal mat accumulations that greatly depress abundance. Additionally, there is evidence (observations that the clam Macoma balthica establishes large populations only when the amphipod A. abdita is not abundant) that species interactions can contribute greatly to interannual variations. Thus, while community composition may change little over the long term, year-to-year predictability of species abundances is low.},

Since microorganisms play a key role in wetland biogeochemical processes and respond quickly to environmental disturbances, this review paper describes the different macro indicators used in wetland biological monitoring and expands the potential use of microbial indicators in wetland assessment and management. Application of molecular microbial technologies paves the path to an integrated measure of wetland health conditions. For example, the ratio of ammonia-oxidizing archaeal and bacterial populations has been proposed to serve as a microbial indicator of wetland nutrient conditions. The microbial indicators coupled with physical, chemical and other biological parameters are vital to the development of multi-metric index for measuring wetland health conditions.

Consequently, an accurate method to quantify the effect of wetlands on coastal surge levels is required. The degree to which wetlands attenuate surge is the subject of debate and difficult to assess. The potential of wetlands to reduce storm surge has typically been expressed as a constant attenuation rate, but the relationship is much more complex. A numerical storm surge model was applied to assess the sensitivity of surge response to specified wetland loss. Results suggest that wetlands do have the potential to reduce surges but the magnitude of attenuation is dependent on the surrounding coastal landscape and the strength and duration of the storm forcing. Numerical models that simulate the relevant physical processes can provide valuable information on how to best integrate wetlands into coastal protection plans. However, while the model applied for this study has displayed skill in estimating surges over wetlands, the formulations are missing key processes and model advancements are necessary.},

More than 100,000 ha were affected, with 43,000 ha severely damaged. The aim of this work was to determine if sudden dieback could have been caused by a coincident drought and to assess the significance of this event with respect to long-term changes in coastal vegetation. Location  Multiple dieback sites and reference sites were established along 150 km of shoreline in coastal Louisiana, {USA}. Methods  Aerial and ground surveys were conducted from June 2000 to September 2001 to assess soil conditions and plant mortality and recovery. Results  Dieback areas ranged in size from ∼300 m2−5 km2 in area with 50–100\% mortality of plant shoots and rhizomes in affected zones. Co-occurring species such as Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and Juncus roemerianus (needlegrass rush) were unaffected. Historical records indicate that precipitation, river discharge, and mean sea level were unusually low during the previous year. Although the cause of dieback is currently unknown, plant and soil characteristics were consistent with temporary soil desiccation that may have reduced water availability, increased soil salinity, and/or caused soil acidification (via pyrite oxidation) and increased uptake of toxic metals such as Fe or Al. Plant recovery 15 months after dieback was variable (0–58\% live cover), but recovering plants were vigorous and indicated no long-lasting effects of the dieback agent. Main conclusions  These findings have relevance for global change models of coastal ecosystems that predict vegetation responses based primarily on long-term increases in sea level and submergence of marshes. Our results suggest that large-scale changes in coastal vegetation may occur over a relatively short time span through climatic extremes acting in concert with sea-level fluctuations and pre-existing soil conditions.},

We analyzed {RM} which was released in the course of the Kolontar disaster in Hungary into the environment in acute and genotoxicity experiments with plants which are widely used for environmental monitoring. We detected induction of micronuclei which reflect chromosomal damage in tetrads of Tradescantia and in root cells of Allium as well as retardation of root growth with contaminated soils and leachates. Chemical analyses showed that {RM} contains metals, in particular high concentrations of vanadium. Follow-up experiments indicated that vanadate causes the effects in the plants. This compound causes also in humans {DNA} damage and positive results were obtained in carcinogenicity studies. Since it was found also in {RM} from other production sites our findings indicate that its release in the environment is a global problem which should be studied in more detail.

Box 3348, Orlando, {FL} 32802, {USA}. 2) technology has been proposed as a mechanism to minimize wetland impacts associated with traditional bucket dredging technologies and to restore soil elevations in deteriorated marshes of the Mississippi River delta. The impact of spray dredging on vegetated marsh and adjacent shallow-water habitat (formerly vegetated marsh that deteriorated to open water) was evaluated in a 0.5-ha Spartina alterniflora-dominated salt marsh in coastal Louisiana. The thickness of dredged sediment deposits was determined from artificial soil marker horizons and soil elevation change was determined from sedimentation–erosion tables ({SET}) established prior to spraying in both sprayed and reference marshes. The vertical accretion and elevation change measurements were made simultaneously to allow for calculation of shallow (∼5 m depth) subsidence (accretion minus elevation change). Measurements made immediately following spraying in July 1996 revealed that stems of S. alterniflora were knocked down by the force of the spray and covered with 23 mm of dredged material. Stems of S. alterniflora soon recovered, and by July 1997 the percent cover of S. alterniflora had increased three-fold over pre-project conditions. Thus, the layer of dredged material was thin enough to allow for survival of the S. alterniflora plants, with no subsequent colonization by plant species typical of higher marsh zones. By February 1998, 62 mm of vertical accretion accumulated at this site, and little indication of disturbance was noted. Although not statistically significant, soil elevation change was greater than accretion on average at both the spray and reference marshes, suggesting that subsurface expansion caused by increased root biomass production and/or pore water storage influence elevation in this marsh region. In the adjacent shallow water pond, 129 mm of sediment was deposited in July 1996 as a result of spraying, and despite initial shallow subsidence and continual erosion through February 1998, water bottom elevation was raised sufficiently to allow S. alterniflora to invade via rhizome growth from the adjacent marsh. Hence, thin-layer deposition of dredged material at this site was effective at restoring and maintaining marsh elevation after 1.5 years. However, if the open water sediment deposits are not soon completely stabilized via further vegetative colonization, erosion may eventually lower elevations to the level where emergent vegetation cannot persist.},

Exogenous {CO}2 in the presence of these nutrient solutions uniformly caused a marked decrease in H+ secretion, {PD}, adn short-circuit current (Isc) and an increase in transmucosal resistance (R). Elevation of nutrient [k+] to 83 {mM} reduced R significantly but transiently without change in H+ when nutrient {pH} less than 5.0, whereas R returned to base line and H+ increased when nutrient {pH} greater than 5.0. Acidification of the nutrient medium in the presence of exogenous {CO}2 results in inhibition of the secretory pump, probably by decreasing intracellular {pH}, and also interferes with conductance at the nutrient membrane. Removal of exogenous {CO}2 from standard bicarbonate nutrient solution reduced by 50\% the H+, {PD}, and Isc without change in R; K+-free nutrient solutions reverse these changes in Isc and {PD} but not in H+. The dropping {PD} and rising R induced by K+-free nutrient solutions in 5\% {CO}2 - 95\% O2 are returned toward normal by 100\% O2.

This work quantifies the vertical sediment dynamics along the tidal gradient in low marshes in an extensive salt marsh restoration project, 26 months after planting Spartina maritima, in comparison with adjacent non-restored and preserved marshes in the Odiel Marshes (southwest Iberian Peninsula). The vertical sediment dynamics was recorded using markers consisting of an iron structure with two vertical posts and a horizontal crossbar, measuring the distance from the middle point of the crossbar to the sediment surface periodically between March 2009 and March 2011. The sediment dynamics was independent of the marsh elevation, depending mainly on plant cover. Erosion was lower in the S. maritima zone (mean accretion rate between +10 and +27 mm yr−1; mean accumulated erosion between +22 and +51 mm after 2 yr) than in bare intertidal mudflats (−14 to +12 mm yr−1; −36 to +37 mm after 2 yr). At higher elevations colonized by Sarcocornia perennis, sediment dynamics changed markedly, depending on marsh type (−10 to 14 mm yr−1; −31 to +29 mm after 2 yr). Extensive salt marsh plantations using S. maritima behaved in a similar way to natural preserved marshes after ca. 2 yr with a relative cover of 62\%, this being a useful tool to stabilize eroding areas in European marshes, since they reduced erosion and increased accretion.},

* • For one species, plastic responses led to reduced hydrodynamic forces, without apparent costs to reproduction, indicating that the plastic response could be beneficial for plant maintenance in stressful habitats. For two species, plastic responses were not associated with variations in performance and reproduction, possibly because of the low hydrodynamic forces experienced, even for morphologies produced under standing conditions. For one species, plastic responses were associated with a sharp decrease in sexual reproduction, without variations in performance, revealing the negative impact of currents over a short time scale.

	abstract = {Wetlands in the Mississippi River deltaic plain are deteriorating in part because levees and control structures starve them of sediment. In spring 2011 a record-breaking flood brought discharge on the lower Mississippi River to dangerous levels, forcing managers to divert up to 3,500 m3 s−1 of water to the Atchafalaya River Basin. Here we use field-calibrated satellite data to quantify differences in inundation and sediment-plume patterns between the Mississippi and Atchafalaya River. We assess the impact of these extreme outflows on wetland sedimentation, and use in situ data collected during the historic flood to characterize the Mississippi plume’s hydrodynamics and suspended sediment. We show that a focused, high-momentum jet emerged from the leveed Mississippi, and delivered sediment far offshore. In contrast, the plume from the Atchafalaya was more diffuse; diverted water inundated a large area, and sediment was trapped within the coastal current. The largest sedimentation, of up to several centimetres, occurred in the Atchafalaya Basin despite the larger sediment load carried by the Mississippi. Sediment accumulation was lowest along the shoreline between the two river sources. We conclude that river-mouth hydrodynamics and wetland sedimentation patterns are mechanistically linked, providing results that are relevant for plans to restore deltaic wetlands using artificial diversions.},

	abstract = {The relationship between ammonia-oxidizing bacteria ({AOB}) and potential nitrification rates was examined along a salinity gradient in a New England estuary in spring and late summer over 3 years. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria abundance was estimated by measuring gene copies of the ammonia monooxygenase catalytic subunit ({amoA}) using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria abundance ranged from below detection to 6.0 × 107amoA copies (gdw sediment)−1. Mean potential nitrification rates ranged from 0.5 to 186.5 nmol N (gdw sediment)−1 day−1. Both {AOB} abundance and potential rates were significantly higher in spring than late summer. Correlations between rates and abundance varied significantly among sites, but showed site-specific ammonia oxidation kinetics related to {AOB} community structure. The effect of salinity on potential nitrification rates was evaluated by incubating sediment from each site under four salinity conditions (0, 5, 10 and 30 psu). At all sites, rates were generally highest in the intermediate salinity treatments, but rates at the upstream site were inhibited at high salinity, while rates at the two downstream sites were inhibited at the lowest salinity. Although salinity appears to be an important factor in determining {AOB} distribution, it may not be the primary factor as {AOB} exhibited a broad range of salinity tolerance in our experiments. Our results indicate that there are significant differences in abundance and community composition of {AOB} along the salinity gradient, and the differences are reflected in community function.},

	abstract = {Storms have long been recognized as agents of geomorphic change to coastal wetlands. A review of recent data on soil elevation dynamics before and after storms revealed that storms affected wetland elevations by storm surge, high winds, and freshwater flushing of the estuary (inferred). The data also indicate that measures of sediment deposition and erosion can often misrepresent the amount and even direction of elevation change because of storm influences on subsurface processes. Simultaneous influence on both surface and subsurface processe by storms means that soil elevation cannot always be accurately estimated from surface process data alone. Eight processes are identified as potentially influencing soil elevation: sediment deposition, sediment erosion, sediment compaction, soil shrinkage, root decomposition (following tree mortality from high winds), root growth (following flushing with freshwater, inferred), soil swelling, and lateral folding of the marsh root mat. Local wetland condition (e.g., marsh health, tide height, groundwater level) and the physical characteristics of the storm (e.g., angle of approach, proximity, amount of rain, wind speed, and storm surge height) were apparently important factors determining the storm's effect on soil elevation. Storm effect on elevation were both permanent (on an ecological time scale) and short-lived, but event short-term changes have potentially important ecological consequences. Shallow soil subsidence or expansion caused by a storm must be considered when calculating local rates of relative sea level rise and evaluating storm effects on wetland stability.},

	abstract = {The Mississippi River delta is undergoing a catastrophic drowning, whereby 5,000 km2 of low-lying wetlands have converted to open water over at least the past eight decades, as a result of many anthropogenic and natural factors. Continued net land loss has been thought inevitable due to a decline in the load of total suspended sediment—both sand and mud—carried by the river. However, sand—which accounts for ∼50–70\% of modern and ancient Mississippi delta deposits but comprises only ∼20\% of the sampled portion of the total load—could be more important than mud for subaerial delta growth. Historically, half of the Mississippi River sediment load is supplied by the Missouri River. Here we analyse suspended sediment load data from two locations downstream from the lowest Missouri River dam to show that the measured sand load in the lower 1,100 km of the Mississippi River has not significantly diminished since dam construction. A one-dimensional numerical model of river morphodynamics predicts that the sand load feeding the delta will decrease only gradually over the next several centuries, with an estimated decline from current values of no more than about 17\% within the coming six centuries. We conclude that the lower Mississippi River channel holds a significant reservoir of sand that is available to replenish diminished loads via bed scour and substantially mitigate land loss.},

We will use some of the most anthropogenically altered {LDE} systems in the world, the Mississippi/Atchafalaya River and the Chinese rivers that enter the Yellow Sea (e.g., Huanghe and Changjiang) as case-studies, to posit that these systems are both “drivers” and “recorders” of natural and anthropogenic environmental change. Specifically, the processes in the {LDE} can influence (“drive”) the flux of particulate and dissolved materials from the continents to the global ocean that can have profound impact on issues such as coastal eutrophication and the development of hypoxic zones. {LDE} also record in their rapidly accumulating subaerial and subaqueous deltaic sediment deposits environmental changes such as continental-scale trends in climate and land-use in watersheds, frequency and magnitude of cyclonic storms, and sea-level change. The processes that control the transport and transformation of carbon in the active {LDE} and in the deltaic sediment deposit are also essential to our understanding of carbon sequestration and exchange with the world ocean—an important objective in global change research.

	abstract = {It is well established that waves propagating through a viscoelastic medium experience both attenuation and frequency modulation. For the case of infinitesimal waves, linear theory may be utilized to solve the boundary value problem for either a complex wavenumber or a complex frequency, the imaginary components corresponding to exponential decay in space and time, respectively. Recent contributions to the body of literature on weakly nonlinear resonant interactions have demonstrated that, in an inviscid two-layer system, internal waves can be parametrically excited by surface waves. Exponential growth, rather than decay, of the internal waves has been predicted and conclusively verified in the laboratory. The two mechanisms are considered together in the current paper. By considering a two-layer system possessing both weak nonlinearity and viscoelasticity, the competition between the two effects is demonstrated. It is found that viscoelasticity reduces the exponential growth rate of the internal waves. Sufficiently large viscoelasticity is found to completely suppress the destabilizing effects of the nonlinearity. General results as well as results for conditions characteristic of an estuarine environment are presented.},

	abstract = {It is increasingly recognised that interactions between geomorphological and biotic processes control the functioning of many ecosystem types as described e.g. by the ecological theory of ecosystem engineering. Consequently, the need for specific bio-geomorphological research methods is growing recently. Much research on bio-geomorphological processes is done in coastal marshes. These areas provide clear examples of ecosystem engineering as well as other bio-geomorphological processes: Marsh vegetation slows down tidal currents and hence stimulates the process of sedimentation, while vice versa, the sedimentation controls ecological processes like vegetation succession. This review is meant to give insights in the various available methods to measure sedimentation, with special attention to their suitability to quantify bio-geomorphological interactions. The choice of method used to measure sedimentation is important to obtain the correct parameters to understand the biogeomorphology of tidal salt marshes. This review, therefore, aims to be a tool for decision making regarding the processes to be measured and the methods to be used. We, subdivide the methods into those measuring suspended sediment concentration (A), sediment deposition (B), accretion (C) and surface-elevation change (D). With this review, we would like to further encourage interdisciplinary studies in the fields of ecology and geomorphology.},

	abstract = {{AbstractTropical} cyclones deliver intense winds that can generate some of the most severe surface wave and storm surge conditions in the coastal ocean. Hurricane Irene (2011) crossed a large, shallow lagoonal estuarine system in North Carolina, causing flooding and erosion of the adjacent low-lying coastal plain and barrier islands. This event provided an opportunity to improve understanding of the estuarine response to strong and rotating wind forcing. Observations from acoustic sensors in subestuaries and water-level elevation measurements from a network of pressure sensors across the system are presented. Data are examined with two modeling techniques: (1) a simple numerical approach using a momentum balance between the wind stress, flow acceleration, pressure gradient, and bottom friction that gives insight into temporal variability in water levels through the passage of the storm; and (2) an advanced hydrodynamic model based on the full shallow water fluid momentum equations, coupled to a spectral surface wave model that accounts for the spatially varying bathymetry and wind field. The results indicate that both wind-generated surface waves and the wind-driven storm surge are important contributors to the total water surface elevations that induce flooding along estuarine shorelines under strong hurricane forcing.},

	abstract = {Computed tomography ({CT}) imaging has been used to describe and quantify subtidal, benthic animals such as polychaetes, amphipods, and shrimp. Here, for the first time, {CT} imaging is used to quantify wet mass of coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in cores collected from organic-rich (Jamaica Bay, New York) and mineral (North Inlet, South Carolina) Spartina alterniflora soils. Image analysis software was coupled with the {CT} images to measure abundance and diameter of the coarse roots and rhizomes in marsh soils. Previously, examination of marsh roots and rhizomes was limited to various hand-sieving methods that were often time-consuming, tedious, and error prone. {CT} imaging can discern the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat based on their varying particle densities. Calibration rods composed of materials with standard densities (i.e., air, water, colloidal silica, and glass) were used to operationally define the specific x-ray attenuations of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in the marsh cores. Significant regression relationships were found between the {CT}-determined wet mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes and the hand-sieved dry mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes in both the organic-rich and mineral marsh soils. There was also a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the {CT}-determined peat particle density among organic-rich and mineral soils. In only the mineral soils, there was a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the {CT}-determined peat wet mass. Using {CT} imaging, significant positive nitrogen fertilization effects on the wet masses of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat, and the abundance and diameter of rhizomes were measured in the mineral soils. In contrast, a deteriorating salt marsh island in Jamaica Bay had significantly less mass of coarse roots and rhizomes at depth (10–20 cm), and a significantly lower abundance of roots and rhizomes compared with a stable marsh. However, the diameters of the rhizomes in the deteriorating marsh were significantly greater than in the stable marsh. {CT} imaging is a rapid approach to quantify coarse roots, rhizomes, peat, and soil particle densities in coastal wetlands, but the method is unable at this time to quantify fine roots.},

	abstract = {To better understand how tides affect the soil conditions of salt marshes, pore-water flow in a modeled 3-D creek-marsh system was simulated under the influence of both monochromatic and spring-neap tides. In analyzing the simulation results, six indices, viz., marsh surface elevation ({SE}), hydroperiod ({HP}), shortest distance to creeks ({SDC}), mean soil water saturation ({MSS}), soil saturation index ({SSI}), and net water flux ({NWF}), were examined across the marsh surface. The results demonstrated that {MSS}, {SSI}, and {NWF} exhibited corresponding patterns of spatial variations, which were related to marsh {SE}, {HP}, {SDC}, and tidal regime. Although the relationships could be described by a simple function under monochromatic tides, under spring-neap tides, the relationships were more complex with different behaviors in the lower and upper marsh areas. The {SDC} was a critically important factor affecting soil conditions. Well-aerated and -drained zones coexisted near the creek under both monochromatic and spring-neap tides. Spring-neap tides led to improved soil aeration in the upper marsh, including the interior section (away from the creek) where the {HP} and inundation frequency were reduced during neap tides. However, the local flushing condition did not improve correspondingly. The study suggests that single morphological index cannot describe the soil conditions adequately. A proper representation of the soil conditions for plant growth and distribution should take into account not only the aeration condition but also the flushing condition. For that purpose, a composite index is needed to combine the soil water saturation index and the net flux index.},

	abstract = {Rising sea levels threaten the sustainability of coastal wetlands around the globe, thus understanding how increased inundation alters the elevation change mechanisms in these systems is increasingly important. Typically, the ability of coastal marshes to maintain their position in the intertidal zone depends on the accumulation of both organic and inorganic materials, so one, if not both, of these processes must increase to keep pace with rising seas, assuming all else constant. To determine the importance of vegetation in these processes, we measured elevation change and surface accretion over a 4-year period in recently subsided, unvegetated marshes, resulting from drought-induced marsh dieback, in paired planted and unplanted plots. We compared soil and vegetation responses in these plots with paired reference plots that had neither experienced dieback nor subsidence. All treatments (unvegetated, planted, and reference) were replicated six times. The recently subsided areas were 6–10 cm lower in elevation than the reference marshes at the beginning of the study; thus, mean water levels were 6–10 cm higher in these areas vs. the reference sites. Surface accretion rates were lowest in the unplanted plots at 2.3 mm yr−1, but increased in the presence of vegetation to 16.4 mm yr−1 in the reference marsh and 26.1 mm yr−1 in the planted plots. The rates of elevation change were also bolstered by the presence of vegetation. The unplanted areas decreased in elevation by 9.4 mm yr−1; whereas the planted areas increased in elevation by 13.3 mm yr−1, and the reference marshes increased by 3.5 mm yr−1. These results highlight the importance of vegetation in the accretionary processes that maintain marsh surface elevation within the intertidal zone, and provide evidence that coastal wetlands may be able to keep pace with a rising sea in certain situations.},

The estuary was in the direct path of hurricane Katrina in 2005, which caused a dramatic loss of wetlands in the upper basin. From March 2006 to October 2007, we made duplicate measurements at three distance classes from the diversion structure along the estuarine gradient as well as at a reference area, designated Near (N1\&2), Mid (M1\&2), Far (F1\&2), and Ref (R1\&2). Above- and belowground live biomass, porewater nutrients ({NOx}, {NH}4, and {PO}4), salinity, sulfide, and soil Eh were measured every 2 months. Water level was monitored with gauges. Above- and belowground decomposition was measured using the litterbag (both) and cotton strip (belowground only) methods. Analysis of porewater parameters showed that stress factors affecting biomass production (porewater salinity, sulfide, flooding, and redox potential) were generally low to moderate, while measurable porewater nutrient concentrations occurred at all sites. Aboveground end of season live ({EOSL}) standing crop in October ranged from 423 g/m2 at site M2 to 1,515 at site F1, and was significantly greater at site N1 than at sites N2, M1, or M2. Aboveground {EOSL} biomass during this study was significantly lower than previously measured in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Peak belowground biomass ranged from 8,315 g/m2 at site R2 to 17,890 g/m2 at site N1, which is among the highest reported in the literature, and there were significant increases throughout the study, suggesting recovery from hurricane Katrina. The decomposition bag data did not indicate any significant differences; however, the cotton strip decomposition rate was significantly lower at the lowest depth. Wetland surface vertical accretion ranged from 0.49 cm/year at N2 to 1.24 cm/year at N1, with site N1 significantly greater than N2, M1, F2, and R1, and site N2 significantly less than all other sites except site R1. These findings show that marsh productivity and stability is related to a number of factors and no one factor can explain the impacts of the hurricanes.},

\begin{abstract}
As concerns about sea-level rise mount, municipalities in coastal areas are looking to nature-based protection and adaptation. Oftentimes such projects are marsh creations or restorations, where areas of open water are filled with dredged material to an elevation where emergent vegetation can grow. We are investigating ways biosolids can be used as an amendment to dredged material to enhance project outcomes. Marsh mesocosms were constructed in San Francisco Bay and planted with native cordgrass, \textit{Spartina foliosa}. Some mesocsoms contained a subsurface layer of biosolids. Vegetation grown with biosolids had significantly increased number of new shoots, aboveground biomass, and belowground biomass. Vegetation with only dredged material had greater rooting depths but this result was not significant. By combining natural processes with human infrastructure, the application of biosolids for marsh creation is a sustainable practice.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

It is well established that salt marshes provide vital ecosystem services, such as assimilating nutrients, providing habitat, sequestering carbon, and attenuating wave action \cite{mitsch_wetlands_2007, ouyang_updated_2014, pinsky_quantifying_2013}. There is great interest in rebuilding salt marshes in order to restore these functions, particularly as they pertain to coastal protection \citep[and references therein]{narayan_effectiveness_2016}. These marsh restorations typically consist of raising the elevation of an area of open water to the point where emergent vegetation can take hold; this process requires a large input of sediment. Material dredged from waterways is most commonly used, and the reuse of this dredged material is encouraged by federal agencies \cite{u.s._environmental_protection_agency_identifying_2007}. Herein we propose and discuss another possible source of sediment, biosolids. Biosolids are the solids product of modern wastewater treatment and are ubiquitous in populated areas. Depending on their properties and the properties of the receiving waters, biosolids fit into one of three categories: 1) source of fill material; 2) beneficial amendment to other fill material; 3) harmful material not to be used. We investigate this second category, using biosolids as an amendment to dredged material.

Here, we investigate this second category, using biosolids as an amendment to dredged material. 

\subsection{Background}
\label{background marsh}

\subsubsection{Marsh Restoration and Sediment Amendments}
\label{background mrsa}

Dredged material is one of the only sources of sediment suitable for marsh restoration projects and available in the quantities needed. Dredged material tends to have a high sand content, which aides the dewatering and consolidation processes but also causes the restored marsh soil to differ from established marshes (\textit{e.g.} lower organic matter, lower water content, and higher bulk density \cite{armitage_influence_2014, fearnley_soil_2008,streever_spartina_2000, edwards_comparison_2003, feagin_does_2009}). As with most newly restored marshes, dredge-material marshes tend to have less belowground biomass \cite{tong_salt_2013,armitage_influence_2014,streever_spartina_2000, boyer_evaluating_2000}. Streever \textit{et al.} \cite{streever_spartina_2000} performed a review of restorations and found no evidence that levels of organic matter in dredge-material marshes were increasing over time to reach levels of established marshes.   

In order to improve performance of dredged-material marshes and accelerate restoration, sediment amendments ranging from compost to direct nutrient addition have been suggested and tested \cite{cain_using_2014, kelley_evaluation_1995, fearnley_soil_2008}. Mimicking edaphic conditions of established marshes can help restore driving physical processes \cite{zedler_handbook_2001}. Increased nutrients can help overcome other stressors (eg. salinity \cite{cavalieri_evaluation_1979}). In southern California, rototilling kelp compost was found to significantly increase the height and stem density of \textit{Spartina foliosa} \cite{obrien_accelerating_2006}. Products like the Gulf Saver\textsuperscript{\textregistered} bag use compost in an effort to increase the survival of the vegetation transplants \cite{sullivan_employing_2010}. Some biosolids-derived compost products are already being used in restorations (\textit{e.g.} in a riparian wetlands \cite{sutton-grier_organic_2009} ). 

\subsubsection{Biosolids}
\label{background biosolids}

The term ``biosolids''was recognized by Water Environment Federation in 1991 in response to advances in treatment technology that produced material safe for reuse \cite{lu_land_2012}. The term ``sludge'' now typically refers to the solids portion of wastewater while undergoing treatment, but prior to 1991, it referred to the solids at any treatment stage. Biosolids are continuously produced in all populated areas. In 1998, approximately 6.2 million dry metric tons were produced in the U.S. \cite{u.s._environmental_protection_agency_biosolids_1999}, and in California, 688,000 dry metric tons were produced in 2014 \cite{california_association_of_sanitation_agencies_biosolids_2015}. These figures increase as the population increases. The composition of biosolids varies depending on the specific treatment processes (\textit{e.g.} anaerobic digestion, chemical stabilization, composting) and waste streams being treated (\textit{e.g.} industrial, residential). They characteristically contain organic matter and nutrients, as well as heavy metals. Land application of biosolids is guided by U.S. EPA regulations so that land owners can take advantage of the well-established soil-improving benefits of biosolids application, while preventing potentially harmful accumulation of contaminants \cite{lu_land_2012, garcia-orenes_factors_2005, tian_stability_2013}. 

\subsubsection{Biosolids in Salt Marshes}
\label{background biosolids salt marsh}
Biosolids in wetlands are often thought of in the fresh water context, as there is extensive research on the use of wetlands to treat wastewater (\textit{e.g.} \cite{kadlec_treatment_2008}). While that practice is beneficial and can be used in conjunction with restoration (\textit{e.g.} freshwater assimilation wetlands \cite{day_jr._use_2004}), it is not our focus. We focus on the use of biosolids as part of the soil in salt marshes. 

There are a few previous studies that have looked at the impact of biosolids in salt marshes. In the 1970s, I. Valiela, J.M. Teal, and coauthors sought to understand the potential consequences of sewage sludge contamination. They measured vegetation and nutrient responses to a bi-weekly broadcast of sewage sludge in a salt marsh in Massachusetts. They measured an increase in aboveground biomass \cite{valiela_production_1975}, decrease in root mass, and no effect on rhizomes \cite{valiela_production_1976}.  Haines \cite{haines_growth_1979} performed a similar experiment in Georgia, applying dried sewage sludge to a salt marsh, and found an increase in aboveground and belowground biomass. Vance \textit{et al.} \cite{vance_effects_2003} investigated the potential of converting sewage oxidation ponds to marshes. They found no statistical difference in final biomass between samples grown in 0\% and 70\% sewage sludge. This result was likely due to its aged nature, as the sewage sludge contained low concentrations of organic matter (about 2\%).  
\begin{align*}
\mathcal {G}(f):=\{G\subseteq \mathbb {R}^n|\ G\ne \emptyset \ \text {is a face of}\ {{\mathrm {New}}}_{\infty }(f)\ \text {with}\ 0\not \in G\} \boldsymbol{K} 
\end{align*}
Results from previous studies indicate that a biosolids amendment containing organic matter and nutrients could be beneficial to vegetation, especially at early stages of marsh development. This use of biosolids as an amendment in restoration projects provides an opportunity to connect human infrastructure and natural coastal processes. Inspired by this opportunity, we designed one possible implementation technique and tested it with mesocosms installed within a marsh. The implementation uses local constraints relevant for marsh restoration in San Francisco Bay. 

\section{Methods}
\label{methods}

\subsection{Study Site}
\label{studysite}

The study site for the field experiments was Western Stege Marsh. It is a 0.04 km\textsuperscript{2} tidally influenced salt marsh in Richmond, California, and is part of the San Francisco Bay estuary. The mean tidal range is 1.3 m, and the two dominant vegetation species are \textit{Spartina foliosa} (Pacific cordgrass) in the low marsh and \textit{Salicornia pacifica} (pickleweed) in the mid to high marsh~\cite{tetra_tech_em_inc_year_2010}. 


\subsection{Mesocosms}
\label{meso}

To study the effect of biosolids as an amendment, an array of marsh mesocosms was constructed (Figure \ref{fig:MarshOrgan}). In-situ mesocosms are recommended for testing new restoration techniques \cite{callaway_using_1997}. This array consisted of 24 PVC pipes each with a 15 cm diameter that was open to the bottom sediment. The array of pipes was built into the bank of a tidal creek, adjacent to the marsh platform. The top of the pipes had an elevation even with the surrounding marsh, which was confirmed using a laser level. This design allowed for control of the pipe substrate while exposing the vegetation to natural conditions. It was inspired by ``marsh organs,'' a well-documented design for measuring primary production of marsh vegetation~\cite{fahey_principles_2007}.

Each pipe was filled with a specific substrate, described in Section \ref{substrate_methods}, and planted with \textit{S. foliosa} sourced from the surrounding marsh on December 22, 2015. The shock of transplanting vegetation from one environment to another is commonly damaging. Not all transplanted vegetation senesced and regrew new shoots, as expected. Pipes without alive shoots were replaced, and on June 16, 2016, all pipes had one alive stem at least 10 cm tall. Shoots were individually tracked over the course of multiple site visits, which allowed us to determine at the end of the experiment if shoots were old (\textit{i.e.} transplanted from the marsh) or new growth (\textit{i.e.} grew on its own). These are the definitions for `new' and `old' used herein. The entire array was wrapped in a plastic mesh to prevent herbivory.  Two 4 mm holes were drilled 10 cm from the top of each pipe to allow some drainage. 

\subsection{Substrate}
\label{substrate_methods}

Since a typical rooting depth of \textit{S. foliosa} is 30 cm~\cite{callaway_introduction_1992}, the top 30 cm of each pipe was the focus of the experiment. From 30 cm to the ground (61.4 cm total), the pipes were filled with dredged material sourced from Martinez Harbor (Martinez, CA) or clean sand. A layer of burlap was used to denote the 30 cm mark. 

Of the 24 pipes, 16 were control pipes. The top 30 cm of control pipes were filled with dredged material obtained from the Hamilton Wetlands Restoration Project site. This material was sourced from the Port of Oakland deepening project and began dewatering in 2008. We collected this material on December 15, 2015.\footnote{The results presented here are from the second trial of experiments. The first trial resulted in high mortality rates of vegetation in control pipes. Informed by this result, one of the original biosolids treatments was removed to have twice as many control pipes.}

\begin{figure}[h]
%\centering\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{pipe_cutaway.eps}
\caption{Diagram illustrating the dimensions and contents of the two types of pipe: control pipes with only dredged material (left) and treatment pipes with dredged material and biosolids (right). Numbered boxes show the substrate sampling locations. The dashed line at the 30 cm mark represents the burlap.}
\label{fig:cutaway}
\end{figure}

The remaining 8 pipes contained the same dredged material as the controls plus an 8 cm layer of biosolids starting 12 cm beneath the surface (Figure \ref{fig:cutaway}). The biosolids were obtained from the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) Wastewater Treatment Plant on December 11, 2015. This facility produces Class B biosolids, which are used in agricultural fields and as daily cover in landfills. The biosolids had a soil-like consistency. Chemical properties of the biosolids at the facility were measured 11 days prior to and 18 days after our collection date as part of routine monitoring. These results are used for characterizing the biosolids used here because the  tests show low monthly variability in the biosolids properties. These tests also revealed that the biosolids met the fecal coliform standards for Class A Biosolids (2015 annual maximum \textless 1000 MPN/g) \cite{code_standards_1999}.  

Dredged Material Management Office (DMMO) is the regulating authority for the reuse and dumping of dredged material in San Francisco Bay. Only the biosolids' mercury concentration exceeded the set limits. Mercury in San Francisco Bay is more strictly regulated than in other water bodies because there is an elevated concentration from mining in the watersheds that feed the Bay \cite{davis_reducing_2012}. The concentration was approximately twice the set total maximum daily limit (TMDL) \cite{san_francisco_estuary_institute_dredged_2015, Freitas_annual_2015}. Note, it was 57 times less than U.S. EPA land application limit \cite{code_standards_1999}. When the 8 cm of biosolids is averaged with the 22 cm of dredge, the resulting concentration was under the limit.

At the end of the experiment, chemical and physical properties of the substrate material were analyzed by the University of California Davis Analytical Laboratory. Samples were composites of material from multiple pipes, sampled at the locations shown by the numbered boxes in Figure \ref{fig:cutaway}. The following concentrations were measured using standard operating procedures: total nitrogen, total carbon, ammonium-nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, extractable phosphorus, exchangeable potassium, and organic matter. Proportions of sand, silt, and clay were also determined. 

\subsubsection{Subsurface Layer of Biosolids}
\label{layer_methods}

The biosolids were placed as a subsurface layer for four main reasons. First is to avoid mixing substrates. Mechanically mixing multiple substrates is costly and logistically challenging for large-scale marsh restoration projects. Second is to increase rooting depth. Studies have found that roots are more prolific in areas of high nutrient availability \citep[and references therein]{hodge_plastic_2004}. If nutrients are available near the surface, a shallow root system may develop, which is more prone to erosion \cite{darby_below-_2008}. Third is to prevent rapid loss of nutrients and organic matter and reduce the potential of eutrophication. Burying the biosolids can reduce loss from tidal exchange and aerobic decomposition of organic matter \cite{valiela_nitrogen_1979}. Fourth is to reduce interaction with fauna. The most biologically active soil layer is thought to be the top 15 cm, and as an additional precaution, the biosolids are largely removed from this zone \cite{davis_long-term_2004}. This implementation design is meant to be compatible with the restoration of an area that has not yet been opened to tidal action. It is common for a restoration area to remain leveed off until the filling in of the substrate is complete. Thus, the biosolids would not be in direct contact with surface water. 

The thickness of the subsurface layer was determined by the nutrient and mercury content of the biosolids. The total N content in the top 30 cm was made to match the high end of measurements from an established salt marsh in the area (approximately 1.1\% Total N \cite{Ryan_nitrogen_2012}). Local studies on background nutrient and metal concentrations should be used to understand what concentrations are appropriate for a particular project. 

\subsection{Biomass Characteristics}
\label{biomass_methods}

Peak aboveground biomass for \textit{S. foliosa} in San Francisco Bay is typically reached in October to November depending on timing of rainfall \cite{mahall_ecotone_1976}. The aboveground biomass was clipped at the sediment surface on November 5, 2016, and collected in labeled paper bags. The samples were then sorted and transferred to a forced-air oven for drying. They were sorted into four categories: old and alive, old and dead, new and alive, and new and dead (categories defined in Section \ref{meso}). The samples were dried at 60$^{\circ}$C for 48 hours, which proved sufficient for reaching a constant mass. 

The pipes were removed intact on November 11, 2016, and refrigerated until they could be processed. The top 30 cm of each pipe was sectioned into 2 cm slices (in the vertical direction). Each layer was then washed through 2 mm and 0.5 mm sieves to separate the belowground biomass. The belowground biomass was sorted by dead and alive following the criteria described in Darby and Turner~\cite{darby_below-_2008} and dried in the same manner as aboveground biomass.

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}
\label{stats_methods}

Statistical tests for significance were performed using MATLAB (R2014b). Two-sample t-tests were applied to the data, which had equal variances in the two populations. A significance level of 0.05 was used to reject the null hypothesis. 

\section{Results}
\label{results}

\subsection{Biomass}
\label{biomass_results}

At the end of the growing season, there was more alive biomass in the treatment pipes than the controls. In the treatment pipes, the mean value for alive aboveground biomass was significantly greater (Figure \ref{fig:abg_bgb} panel 1) and the mean value of dead aboveground biomass was significantly less than in the control pipes (Figure \ref{fig:abg_bgb} panel 2). There was no statistically significant difference between the pipes when considering total (alive + dead) aboveground biomass (Figure \ref{fig:abg_bgb} panel 3).

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
%%\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{agb_bgb.eps}
\caption{Metrics of biomass for the treatment and control pipes (AG = Aboveground, BG = Belowground). Mass is given as mass per pipe (cross-sectional area = 1.7x10\textsuperscript{-2} m\textsuperscript{2}). Error bars show standard error. Metrics with statistically significant difference (p\textless 0.05) are marked with an asterisk.}
\label{fig:abg_bgb}
\end{figure}

The growth of shoots was tracked over the course of the experiment. Significantly more new shoots sprouted and survived in treatment pipes (Figure \ref{fig:abg_bgb} panel 4). The maximum for both groups was four new shoots. In the six days between clipping aboveground growth and retrieving the pipes, shoots regrew in 7 of 8 treatment pipes and 6 of 16 control pipes. This regrowth was not included in the biomass or shoot measurements.

Figure \ref{fig:bgb_layers_rd}a shows the vertical distribution of belowground biomass. In only one layer, 6-8 cm, were the means significantly different between the substrates. The treatment pipes had significantly more total belowground biomass (Figure \ref{fig:abg_bgb} panel 5). However, it was more concentrated in the upper portion of the soil column. While not statistically different, the average rooting depth was greater in control pipes (Figure \ref{fig:bgb_layers_rd}b). Dead belowground biomass could not be well distinguished from macro-organic matter and was not included.

\end{figure}

The root to shoot ratio (R:S) is often used to investigate the effect of nutrients on growing patterns. We present this ratio two ways: roots to alive aboveground biomass (alive R:S) and roots to total aboveground biomass (all R:S). For alive R:S, the median values were 0.38 (IQR = 0.28) and 0.65 (IQR = 6.4) for treatment and control pipes, respectively. The high variability in the control results was due to a few pipes with low values alive aboveground biomass. All R:S had less variability with median values of 0.33 (IQR = 0.24) and 0.34 (IQR = 0.24) for treatment and control pipes, respectively. There was no statistical difference between the pipes for either ratio, but there was a slight decrease in R:S with biosolids amendment. The p-values for this and all other tests for significance are given in the Appendix.

\subsection{Chemical and Physical Properties}
\label{chemphys_results}

The carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratios show a greater difference between the old and new vegetation than between the vegetation grown in the different substrates. The old aboveground biomass had higher C:N values than the new, indicating the old vegetation has more refractory organic matter as expected (Table \ref{table:chemprop}). No distinction was made between the stems and leaves.

\label{table:physprop}
\end{table}

The nutrient concentrations in the biosolids decreased over the course of the experiment. Initially, the biosolids contained 1.3x10\textsuperscript{4} mg/kg of NH\textsubscript{4}-N; this value decreased to 1.0x10\textsuperscript{-3} mg/kg. A similar trend can be seen in the NO\textsubscript{3}-N and total N concentrations by comparing the initial biosolids to Location 5 in Table \ref{table:chemprop}. For most concentrations measured, the result at Location 4 (top of biosolids layers) indicates that this material is a mix of mainly biosolids and some dredged material (Table \ref{table:chemprop}). The NO\textsubscript{3}-N concentration is an anomaly at Location 3 (dredged material below the biosolids). The concentration there is measured to be twice the initial concentration in the biosolids. This high concentration is likely pooling of the NO\textsubscript{3}-N; its negative charge allows it to move easily through negatively-charged soil. 

In the aboveground biomass, Cu concentrations were highest in old vegetation and lowest in the new shoots. Although the Cu concentrations were higher in the biosolids than the dredged material by a factor of 10, the data suggest that the vegetation Cu content does not reflect this elevated Cu concentration.  

The tests of physical properties revealed that the different substrates had the same soil texture. Both are classified as sandy loam based on the proportions of sand, silt, and clay. The biosolids are measured to be 80\% sand; this material is likely not all silica, but rather particles that are the same size as sand grains \cite{Haynes_Chapter_2009}. At the end of the experiment, the organic matter content of the biosolids was greater than the dredged material by two orders of magnitude. Statistical significance was not tested for the chemical and physical metrics due to a lack of replicates. 

\section{Discussion}
\label{discussion}

\subsection{Biomass}
\label{biomass_discussion}

Our results support findings that increasing nutrient levels to be more similar to established marshes causes an increase in the production of above- and belowground biomass. We measured greater stem density and alive aboveground biomass in treatment pipes.  This increased biomass can lead to increased wave attenuation \cite{pinsky_quantifying_2013} and sedimentation \cite{bouma_trade-offs_2005}. These processes, in turn, can allow the marsh platform to increase elevation, thereby keeping pace with sea-level rise, as well as increase carbon sequestration. The increased number of new shoots could mean that marshes restored with this technique require less vegetation transplants or that natural recruitment would be more successful, both of which could reduce project costs. The increased nutrients in the treatment pipes did not cause a decrease in belowground biomass (discussed further in Section \ref{layer_design}), but rather, these pipes had significantly greater belowground biomass. Other fertilization experiments with \textit{S. foliosa} have found no statistical difference in belowground biomass \cite{boyer_evaluating_2000, tyler_nitrogen_2007}.

The increased aboveground biomass outweighed the increase in belowground biomass, causing the R:S to decrease with the biosolids treatment. This difference was not statistically significant. The values measured here were less than those for \textit{S. foliosa} in established marshes in Northern and Southern California whose average ratios were greater than 2 \cite{mahall_ecotone_1976, boyer_evaluating_2000}. Wong \textit{et al.} \cite{wong_nutrient_2015} report the changes in R:S from 14 studies of nutrient additions and show that often a decrease in R:S is due to an increase in shoot biomass, rather than a decrease in root biomass. Our findings support those of Merino \textit{et al.}\cite{merino_implication_2010} and Wong \textit{et al.}\cite{wong_nutrient_2015} that increased nutrients does not significantly change the R:S. 

One possible reason we observed a significant response to nutrient input is that the starting \textit{S. foliosa} biomass was low. Other studies have shown that when \textit{S. alterniflora} biomass is low, there is a greater response to nutrient enrichment than when biomass is high \cite{morris_brinson_2013}. A low starting biomass is, however, true of any restoration or creation project. There is a maximum biomass at which additions of nutrients would not have an effect, but typical starting biomass levels are far below this amount \cite{cameron_analysis_1972}. This initial increase in biomass could boost survival rates and project outcomes, particularly in storm-prone areas.

\subsection{Fate of Nutrients}
\label{fate_of_nutrients}

About 92\% of the NH\textsubscript{4}-N and 82\% of NO\textsubscript{3}-N were lost from the biosolids over the course of the experiment.  Some nutrients were assimilated by the vegetation; the treatment vegetation had about 20\% more tissue nitrogen. The concentrations remaining in the biosolids were still greater than those found in the dredged material. With one growing season of data, we cannot definitively say how long these nutrient pools will last or how they will develop over time. 

Typically, added nutrients are lost quickly (\textit{e.g} \cite{wong_nutrient_2015}). Marsh environments, having both aerobic and anaerobic zones, foster nitrification and denitrification, which cause a loss of NH\textsubscript{4}-N and NO\textsubscript{3}/NO\textsubscript{2} \cite{mitsch_wetlands_2007}. Soil texture and organic matter content determine cation exchange capacity, which largely control nutrient retention. In a dredged-material marsh (63\% sand), Gibson \textit{et al.} \cite{gibson_limited_1994} reported 50-66\% of nitrogen was lost within the first two weeks after application. Mendelssohn and Kuhn \cite{mendelssohn_sediment_2003} measured higher retention of potassium and phosphorous in substrate with finer-grained sediments and recommended that future sediment additions have higher clay and silt portions (sand \textless 25\%). Similar recommendations of adding fine grained material and organic amendments were made for restored \textit{S. foliosa} marshes in Southern California to improve nutrient retention\cite{boyer_evaluating_2000}.

Compared to established salt marshes in San Francisco Bay, the percentage of organic matter in the biosolids at the end of the experiment (19.54\%) is similar to samples from mid and high marsh zones (18.0\% and 15.3\%, respectively) and greater than that from low marsh zones (10.3\%) \cite{Callaway_carbon_2012}. The biosolids have values similar to established \textit{S. alterniflora} marshes in Louisiana \cite{stagg_restoring_2010}. It takes time to develop soil carbon and nitrogen pools equivalent to those in established marshes. Whether or not a restoration is developing these pools appears to be site-specific with some studies showing an increase towards concentrations typical of established marshes over time and others showing stagnation \cite{craft_nitrogen_1988, zedler_tracking_1999, edwards_comparison_2003, streever_spartina_2000}.

While the addition of nutrients in dredged-material marshes has been shown to be beneficial, we  acknowledge the concern that excess nutrients leads to deterioration of the ecosystem \cite{deegan_coastal_2012}. Eutrophication of coastal waters is a problem \cite{Millennium_Ecosystem_Assessment_ecosystems_2005}. The addition of nutrients to restoration sites intends to bring concentrations in nutrient-poor substrates up to levels found in the soils of established marshes. These nutrients should be added in a way that does not lead to nutrient pollution of waterways. Once vegetation is established, the marsh can become a net sink of nutrients, increasing water quality \cite{valiela_comparative_2002}. A full review of nutrients in coastal marshes can be found in Morris \textit{et al.} \cite{morris_brinson_2013}. 

%In particular some studies have shown it leads to decreased roots and increased decomposition, making the marsh vulnerable to erosion \cite{darby_below-_2008, turner_beneath_2011, deegan_coastal_2012}. However, there are often other confounding factors at work. A full review of Local studies on background nutrient concentrations should be used to understand what concentrations are appropriate for a particular project. restoring marshes restores natural sinks of nutrients adding nutrients to sediment here is only meant to bring it to natural levels supplement the often nutrient-poor dredged material 


\subsection{Effect of Subsurface Layer}
\label{layer_design}

The biosolids were placed as a subsurface layer rather than being mixed into the top soil. Burying the biosolids in this way intended to encourage roots to grow to this nutrient-rich layer. Although the rooting depth was not significantly different between the substrates, some suggestive patterns emerge. Biomass in treatment pipes often  reached the biosolids layer (7 out 8 pipes) but was never found past it. The maximum rooting depth was 16-18 cm, as opposed to the control pipes with maximum rooting depth at the end of sampling range (28-30 cm). The minimum rooting depth for both the control and treatment pipes was 8-10 cm. The biomass for both substrates was concentrated from the surface to 10 cm down. The increased aboveground biomass and decreased rooting depth measured in the biosolids treatments, although not statistically significant, could create conditions for plant uprooting \cite{turner_beneath_2011}. Evidence of uprooting was not observed here, but wave energy and shear stress at the site should be considered in future implementations. 

Howes \textit{et al.} \cite{howes_hurricane-induced_2010} hypothesized that discontinuities in the soil column caused sections of marsh to bifurcate during Hurricane Katrina. For the area studied, these discontinuities were layers of inorganic sediment in organic freshwater marsh substrate. It is possible that in the event of great shear stress at the marsh surface, the biosolids layer could act as a discontinuity, and slippage could occur. 

In addition to root depth, strata of different redox conditions may influence the optimal depth of the biosolids layer. The nutrients in biosolids could increase microbial activity \cite{sutton-grier_organic_2009}, increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \cite{ballantine_soil_2012}. Since marshes can also be a sink for carbon \cite{adams_nitrous_2012}, further study is needed to understand how biosolids in marsh restorations influence GHG production and the net carbon balance. 

\subsection{Contaminant Concerns}
\label{cont_concerns}

The fate of metals should be further investigated as it pertains to the application of biosolids as a sediment amendment. Here, we measured Cu concentrations to understand the trend in Cu transport. The Cu concentrations were highest in the old vegetation. Since the old vegetation was transplanted from the surrounding marsh, this implies the ambient marsh sediments are contaminated with Cu and potentially other metals. A similar outcome was found by Vance \textit{et al.} \cite{vance_effects_2003}; sediments thought to be clean embankment fill had higher concentrations of metals than the sewage sludge being investigated. These results highlight how common metal-contaminated sediments are in coastal environments. 

By taking up metals into their tissues, marsh vegetation can have a remediating, or at least stabilizing, effect.  Previous studies of \textit{S. alterniflora} have shown that the majority of metals accumulate in the root material with smaller amounts in the stems and leaves \cite{windham_uptake_2003, redondo-gomez_bioaccumulation_2013}. Since roots are largely recalcitrant in a marsh environment, this leads to permanent burial. In our experiment, the Cu concentrations in the biosolids decreased by over 50\% over the course of one growing season. Some of this Cu was measured in the aboveground biomass, but it is likely the concentrations were much higher in the root material. It is unclear why the aboveground biomass grown in control pipes had higher Cu concentrations than the treatment pipes considering the biosolids material had much higher Cu concentrations, even at the end of the experiment. 

This study did not specifically address public health. Yet, there are many emerging contaminants of emerging concern. Some of these are largely hydrophilic (\textit{e.g.} pharmaceuticals) and are currently disposed in waterways via wastewater effluent \cite{richardson_emerging_2017}. Other compounds, such as flame retardants, are removed from wastewater and have been found in biosolids \cite{davis_measurement_2012}. All potential contaminants should remain a consideration, especially as technologies advance for removing these compounds from wastewater. We rely upon U.S. EPA regulations to prevent an unhealthy build-up of metals and other potential contaminants when biosolids are applied on land. In the same way, regulations could be created for the application of biosolids to marshes.


\subsection{Future Implementation}
\label{future_implementation}

The way biosolids were added to dredged material here is just one of a multitude of possible designs. We modeled a process that would be practical in a restoration area that has not been opened to tidal action and is in the process of dewatering the dredged material. However, every restoration project will have particular constraints, and the application of this concept should be considered on a case-by-case basis. The implementation needs to be tailored for the characteristics of the biosolids, other substrates being used, and receiving waters. For example, the number, thickness, and depth of layers are all parameters that could be tuned. Other strategies of application could be explored, such as hydraulically pumping low-solids-content biosolids or using a subsurface injection.  The biosolids may need to undergo additional treatment before they can be used. For example, Reimers \textit{et al.} \cite{reimers_utilization_2015} filed a patent for a treatment process with iron salt and heat application to create a stable product that could be used in this manner. 

The location of biosolids production also makes them attractive for application to marshes. Wastewater treatment plants are often in low lying areas close to water. Transporting biosolids to restoration sites may be less costly and produce less emissions than transporting them to landfills or agricultural land, especially as future regulations may limit disposal options (\textit{e.g.} California SB 1383).

\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusions}


Our results indicate that a biosolids amendment can have a beneficial effect on biomass production in dredge-material marshes. With increases of above- and belowground biomass, salt marshes can become more stable and self-regulating. Although restoration success depends on many factors, the organic matter and nutrient additions can help the vegetation establish and restore key physical processes that drive marsh evolution. To our knowledge, this paper is the first field study of biosolids application with the intent to inform a full-scale marsh restoration. The potential for scaling this concept is great; biosolids are a reliability-produced source of sediment, and by using biosolids as a dredged material amendment, it creates a sustainable sediment source for marsh restorations. Marshes, in turn, can increase a community's resilience with sea-level rise. By integrating our urban infrastructure with natural coastal processes, using a biosolids amendment in marsh restorations is a mutually beneficial process that meets the goals of ecological engineering \cite{mitsch_ecological_2004}.
